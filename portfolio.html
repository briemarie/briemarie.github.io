    <h2>As a part of Dev Bootcamp's curriculum, I completed a solo app challenge during Phase 2, Week 6. I developed a web app, Artsee, which consumes the Brooklyn Museum API to allow for quick art searches based on a desired artist. A future feature of the app will be the integration of a music API that cross references a chosen artwork's creation date and plays music that could have possibly inspired the artist while at work on the piece.<br />

    <h2>In order to graduate Dev Bootcamp, groups completed larger scale apps. My team's app, Vendable, was developed using a Node.js back-end and an AngluarJS/Ionic front-end mobile iOS design. The app is meant to simplify the grocery shopping experience in a big cityâ€” complete with a MongoDB of over 100 thousand items found at big chain grocery stores, the app allows a user to find stores based on a 5 mile radius and create a shopping list of desired items found at a selected store. The list pulls the data and updates the user's list with item prices and and a grand total. When the user is ready, the app uses the Google Maps API to route directions to the chosen store.<br />

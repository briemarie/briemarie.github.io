      <h2>AS A PART OF DEVBOOTCAMP'S CURRICULUM, I COMPLETED A SOLO APP CHALLENGE DURING PHASE 2, WEEK 6. I DEVELOPED AN APP, ARTSEE, WHICH CONSUMES THE BROOKLYN MUSEUM API TO ALLOW FOR QUICK ART SEARCHES BASED ON A DESIRED ARTIST. A FUTURE FEATURE OF THE APP WILL BE A MUSIC PLAYER THAT CROSS REFERENCES THE CHOSEN ARTWORK'S CREATION DATE AND PLAYS MUSIC THAT COULD HAVE POSSIBLY INSPIRED THE ARTIST WHILE AT WORK ON THE PIECE.<br />

      <h2>IN ORDER TO GRADUATE DEVBOOTCAMP, GROUPS COMPLETED LARGER SCALE APPS. MY TEAM'S APP, VENDABLE, WAS DEVELOPED USING A NODE BACK-END AND AN ANGULAR/IONIC FRONT-END MOBILE IOS DESIGN. THE APP IS MEANT TO SIMPLIFY THE GROCERY SHOPPING EXPERIENCE IN A BIG CITY- COMPLETE WITH A MONGODB OF OVER 100 THOUSAND ITEMS FOUND AT BIG CHAIN GROCERY STORES, THE APP ALLOWS A USER TO FIND STORES BASED ON A 5 MILE RADIUS AND CREATE A SHOPPING LIST OF DESIRED ITEMS. THE LIST PULLS THE DATA AND UPDATES THE USER'S LIST WITH ITEM PRICES AND A GRAND TOTAL. WHEN THE USER IS READY, THE APP USES THE GOOGLE MAPS API TO ROUTE THE DIRECTIONS TO THE CHOSEN STORE.<br />

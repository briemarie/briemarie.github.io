              Wow, clearly I proved this blog was a quaratine project—I haven't written a new post in over three years. That isn't to say I've fallen out of love with the world of tech. Quite the opposite. My life has been full of learning and exploring all kinds of new tech. From the biotech of the Covid vaccine and all of the advancements in health around DNA and RNA, to the aerodynamics and fluid dynamics tech of parachutes and wingsuits, to the burgeoning world of AI. My life has continued to be fueled by a passion for tech.
              <br><br>
              Now that the world is open again, I finally had the opportunity to travel outside of the US. While in London, I took the train ride to Bletchley Park. Bletchley Park was the site of a massive operation during World War II to break encrypted German correspondance with cutting edge technology: room sized computers. One of the most prominent figures of this operation was Alan Turing. If you haven't seen The Imitation Game, it's a good Hollywood intro into the history of all that I am going to be talking about. Or maybe, instead of watching the movie, perhaps you took up a previous recommendation of mine and read The Code Book? I mentioned this book in a previous blog post and mentioned specifically that I was reading about the cracking of the Enigma machine during WWII. The Enigma machine encrypted messages were decrypted at Bletchly Park wih the help of Alan Turing and his Bombe machine!
              <br><br>
              Bletchley Park is now the home of the <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.tnmoc.org/">The National Museum of Computing</a>, and on display are the Bombe machine, plus many other computers, showing their evolution over time. Two other computers of note that were also used to crack German encrypted messages were the Heath Robinson and Colossus computers, both designed to break the settings of the Lorenz machine, which like the Enigma, was being used to encrypt German war correspondance. I must admit, that being in the presence of these loud, giant machines, I was left in awe and wonder, but was barely able to grasp how they worked.
              <br><br>
              As a professional software engineer, the number one assumption I hear from people who don't work in tech is that I must be good at math. No I reply, I'm good at writing. This isn't to say I'm not good at math, but I never use it as an engineer. My language and writing skills, however, are a daily requirement for writing readable and reviewable code. I've always wondered where this assumption about needing math skills for programming comes from. Generally speaking, science and math do seem to go hand in hand—for example, physics and mathematics. As someone who didn't get a degree in Computer Science, I think I personally got to skip all of the math aspects of engineering—for example, the dreaded concreate math. I have since taken calculus classes online once I started diving into machine learning, but before that, math and programming were never related in my experience. I write code, which to me is just another language. I suppose it can be argued that math is also another language, however, it is not one that I write in.
              <br><br>
              The room sized computers that broke the German encrypted messages, however, were purely math based! They were programmed with the statistics of recurring letter sequences in the German language, and could determine the specific daily setting of the cipher machines by determining which setting duplicated the same statistical outputs in the encrypted messages! The first computer programs were all math. Another machine that I saw in the museum, which currently holds the world record for oldest working computer, is basically a room sized calculator. I remember too, watching Hidden Figures, about the women "computers" who did the mathematical calculations for sending NASA astronauts to the moon, pretty much by hand. That is, until another room-sized computer was brought in to perform the calculations. I guess I've come into the world of computers and technology so late in the game, that in my eyes, calculators are for math and computers are for everything else humans could want. And to give humans what they want, we egnineers program computers and write apps simply in new languages that both computers and humans understand, little to no math involved.
              <br><br>
              This is why the latest technology to come out and disrupt everything we thought we knew, is the AI known as ChatGPT. What does ChatGPT do? It analyzes human <i>language</i> and seems to understand it so perfectly that it can pass as the most intelligent human being, somehow possessing all knowledge of every subject—including how to write computer programs from simple human prompts. Language. Communication. These are the foundation of engineering for me. Taking this back to the Colossus and other cipher-breaking computers at Bletchley Park—yes, they were programmed with statistics... but statistics of language!
              <br><br>
              None of this is to argue that math isn't important, or that engineering and computers have nothing to do with math. Clearly, math was a fundamental aspect of computers. Also, I must note that ChatGPT "understands" language through advanced machine learning, which is all calculus. I do love to highlight, though, that on the other side of all this math is language, communication, and the humanities. And maybe I shouldn't even say "the other side", since maybe math and language are actually more similar and more intricately tied together than we tend to think. As Colossus has proven, we humans have unconsciously added math into the patterns of our communication with one another. And as Galileo said, "Mathematics is the language with which God has written the universe."

            <p class="entry-date">April 29, 2020</p>
            <p class="copy">
              My nomadic journey continues—this time I drove the entire Pacific coast from San Diego to Seattle! Many parts of the trip were far too beautiful to puncture the serenity with sound and I preferred to drive in silence, hearing only the wind rushing through the evergreen and cypress trees and the waves crashing against the ancient rocks.
              <br><br>
              During the long stretches when I was feeling that I'd like some company though, once again Spotify did not disappoint and I got in several more episodes of my favourite podcast, The Knowledge Project. One in particular with <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/daniel-gross/">Daniel Gross</a> stood out to me, probably because the topics included not only tech, leadership, and the world of startups, but also communication and literature—basically, all topics I geek out on. I don't want to give too much away in case you want to listen to the whole episode, but there are a couple of points that I found particularly noteworthy. 
              <br><br>
              One of the first things that Daniel talked about that blew my mind was around his vision about why YouTube is so important. You know how written language didn't come until many, many thousands of years after we as humans developed verbal language, and how all knowledge before that was passed down through stories, generation after generation? This verbal and visual transmission of information is what we are wired for as humans, and is still to this day one of our most basic ways to create bonds with each other. However, as societies grew larger than our small tribes and trade began to grow, verbal communication was not sufficient for record keeping, and so the written word was invented (for a more detailed history on this I will once again recommend the book <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens/">Sapiens</a>). But, as we all know through misinterpreted text messages and emails, even those saturated with emojis in an attempt to convey some form of facial expression and intended tone, the written word can be lacking as a means of communication. Sure we love to read novels, blogs, and articles, but when it comes down to it, we thrive much more on human interaction and storytelling. There is significantly more information we can absorb from watching and listening to another human tell us a story or convey knowledge.
              <br><br>
              This is precisely the power of YouTube, according to Daniel. Never before have we had the technology to record ourselves as average people from the comfort of our own homes and broadcast ourselves across the entire world, and for free! That's exactly what YouTube has given us the power and ability to do—to tell our stories, impart our particular knowledge, and share our unique perspectives with the world. As a global society, we now have a way to communicate that can not only be transmitted across vast distances and efficiently saved as records, but also one that uses our voice and body to connect and bond with other humans. YouTube is not just entertainment, it's the present and future way to improve how we share stories and knowledge with one another.
              <br><br>
              When it does come to the written word in the form of literature, Daniel has another opinion that resonates with me as a longtime fan of Hunter S. Thompson and his Gonzo journalism. Daniel talks about how fiction can affect our view of the world and mould the way we think more than non-fiction. Hunter S. Thompson similarly believed that fiction contained more truth than journalism, and so was born his unique form of Gonzo journalism where he wrote about real-life events and experiences through a seemingly fictionalized story, such as his most famous <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_and_Loathing_in_Las_Vegas">Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</a>. Daniel believes that when we are engrossed in a fiction story, our guard is down because we know that the story isn't true, and so the view of the world that is conveyed in the story is more easily absorbed by our minds where is can take root in our subconscious. Whereas when we are reading non-fiction, we actively assess whether the ideas fit what we believe to be true and discard them if they don't, therefore blocking their chance to change the way we see the world.
              <br><br>
              All in all these are but two ideas covered in the podcast, and Daniel is a rather fascinating person, so I recommend giving the whole talk a listen to. Who knows, maybe soon I'll stop writing these blog posts and start recording them on YouTube. I'll keep you posted on that. Thanks for <i>reading</i>!

              I'm not a huge fan of social media. I know global virtual connection has its positives, but mostly I've seen the addiction and abuse of social media, so have chosen to avoid most of the platforms—SnapChat, Instagram, Twitter, etc. When <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX8GxLP1FHo">The Great Hack</a> came out and I learned more about <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica">Cambridge Analytica</a> and the use of Facebook user data, I was proud to know that I didn't have a Facebook during that time to have had my data used for false media and manipulation. But as of a year ago when I moved overseas, I set up a Facebook account to keep in touch with friends and family, and over the past few weeks of this self-isolation, have been grateful for the platform. I must admit that I have been displaying some addictive tendencies, namely the constant checking of my feed for something fun or interesting that friends, family, and acquaintances have posted to help me feel less alone during this time. But for the first time, I'm not judging myself or others for this addictive behavior. As socially bonding animals, social media is all we have in a time of social distancing, and it is keeping us from losing a vital part of what it means to be human.
              <br><br>
              With all of that said though, I have still personally found myself feeling quite lonely during this time. I thought maybe it was because I'm still a novice at this whole social media thing—I'm not posting enough, or commenting enough. I haven't yet used FaceTime to connect with friends (I still find it very awkward and don't know where to look or what angle to hold the phone at). But then yesterday I discovered this book by Thich Nhat Hanh, <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.scribd.com/book/163564206/The-Art-of-Communicating">The Art of Communicating</a>, and this passage voiced exactly what I have been feeling:
              <br><br>
            </p>
            <div style="text-align:center;">
              <img style="display:inline-block;height:700px;" src="./new-images/communicating.jpg"/>
            </div>
            <p class="copy">
              <br><br>
              The issue of loneliness is not a technological issue, or a physically distancing issue—it's a communication issue that starts with the conversations I've been having with myself. I hope to keep reminding myself of this passage, and improve how I'm talking to myself and deepen the conversations I'm having with others.
              <br><br>
              With all this contemplation around social media, social bonds, and communication, I did start wondering exactly how Facebook has been able to make it happen that we can stay connected (and when used right, not feel lonely). Just the other day, Facebook suggested that I might know a person, and I did! I've been thinking about this old friend, but couldn't remember her last name. I relinquished the memories to be just that, but then Facebook magic happened and we've reconnected—lo and behold we're only a mile away from each other! How did Facebook do this?
              <br><br>
              <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/under-the-hood-building-out-the-infrastructure-for-graph-search/10151347573598920/">Graph Search!</a> Now it's time to get nerdy (although I do hope you appreciated the philosophical musings and see the beauty of how our organic humanness influences the technology we create). A Facebook graph is the interconnected nodes of all entities (users, posts, places, etc) and the relationships that connect them (friendships, relationships, tags, etc). In order for these connections to produce usable data for recommending people you might know, or pages you might be interested in, or for the search to work when you type something in, Facebook has had to map each entity and each kind of relationship in an unfathomably large index, and then build the algorithms to search this index. Reading this article that details how this was done and how it works blew my mind. Even with everything that has happened, I am now proud to say that Facebook is my only social media. There are some brilliant minds at Facebook making sure I never have to miss a friend again. Thanks Facebook for helping me get through both my world travels and self-isolation!
              <br><br>
              For some additional resources that have spurred these musings, here is a list of some of what I have been reading and listening to recently:
              <br><br>
              <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.ynharari.com/book/homo-deus/">Homo Deus</a> by Yuval Noah Harari. A follow up book to the aforementioned favourite <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens/">Sapiens</a>. While Sapiens is a look into our past as a species, Homo Deus is a look into our possible future, given our current values and trajectory as a species. But whether examining where we came from or where we're going, the message is the same—humans have succeeded in all successful endeavours because of our unique ability to collect in groups, collaborate, and cooperate.
              <br><br>
              <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/sue-johnson/">Dr. Sue Johnson: Cracking the Code of Love</a> podcast on The Knowledge Project. I listened to this podcast at the end of last year, and it has stuck with me ever since. I had never thought of myself or of other humans as "socially bonding animals" until I listened to Sue refer to us as this. I can look back and see that this acknowledgement of my/our nature is what started me on my current path of moving from being independent to being interdependent.
              <br><br>
              <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People">The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a> by Stephen R. Covey. This is where I got the above phrase, "moving from being independent to being interdependent." I've only finished the introductory chapters and haven't yet started to read the habits themselves, but so far I am really enjoying this book. It had been one of those books that I knew everyone raves about, but had put off reading it expecting it to be a bit dry and on the "business" side of things due to the "effective people" part of the title. But this was a misconception, as the book is really about how to be an effective human being interacting with other human beings, whether they be your partner, children, boss, or colleagues. Moral of the story, don't judge a book by its cover, or its name!
              <br><br>

              I realized that in my excitement over The Tao of Physics, I jumped ahead a bit in my last post and never gave an update on finishing <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/the-code-book-how-to-make-it-break-it-hack-it-crack-it_simon-singh/254038/item/1638901/">The Code Book</a> by Simon Singh. I slightly misspoke in my last post about the book when I said that the book "will finish with data encryption as we know it today." The book was published in 2000, and especially in the world of technology, 20 years ago can hardly be considered "today." So the political and ethical dilemmas that were facing the world with the controversial release to the masses of public key cryptography have since become a thing of the past. The book even includes a link to download PGP, <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">Pretty Good Privacy</a>. Since encryption did not come standard with computers and email services back then because of the immense computing power it took, PGP was radical and free software that you could download to generate your own private and public keys, which other users could look up, and you could then use to encrypt and decrypt shared data such as emails. Nowadays, one of the few needs for manually generating private and public key pairs is for programmers needing to connect to GitHub, and we take for granted that all of the data we share online is encrypted and decrypted behind the scenes for us at lightning speeds.
              <br><br>
              However, while addressing concerns that no longer apply to us two decades later, the final chapters of the book do go into a fair amount of detail about the discovery of the same encryption algorithm that we still use today for generating public keys, and are therefore still relevant and fascinating to read. The most I personally knew about the <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">RSA algorithm</a> developed in the 70s was that the basis of it had something to do with very large prime numbers. While I won't recount the math here, the final chapters do detail the mathematics behind the algorithm and how these very large prime numbers work in the algorithm to create the security we all take for granted forty plus years later. And the final chapter poses questions around the threat of quantum computers being able to easily break the RSA algorithm, a threat that is only becoming closer to reality, as I have written about previously. So all in all, 10 thumbs up for The Code Book!

              Wow, I'm only getting worse at this regularly blogging thing—it has officially been a full month since I last wrote. Given the current state of global affairs, I'm sure you'll forgive me though, especially considering that I was traveling around as a self-isolating nomad for two of the past few weeks. As uncertain as traveling around was (I drove 3000 miles, or 4828 kilometers, in 10 days), I was two weeks ahead of the self-isolation measures imposed on us here in California, and was doing it in the most beautiful way possible—seeing five states worth of majestic scenery pass around me as I listened to one of my favourite podcasts, <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/">The Knowledge Project</a>, and streamed hours of fantastic beats (thanks again, Spotify)!
              <br><br>
              But here I am, "settled" and "statically" isolating, ready to start blogging again. The feeling of my fingers typing is bringing me much joy, and the clickity-clack of the keys is a familiar melody that I didn't realize how much I missed. So here it goes, my current coronavirus musings...
              <br><br>
              As a preface, you should know that I am currently reading <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tao_of_Physics">The Tao of Physics (Third Edition)</a> by Fritjof Capra and am absolutely loving it. The parallels between Eastern philosophies and physics, namely quantum mechanics, is beautiful to behold. As a meditator, I have felt for many years the interconnectedness of all things and events, and have attributed my understanding of theories of the multiverse, quantum entanglement, and superposition to my meditation practice and the states of consciousness I have reached through it. To read a book that gives scientific evidence to Eastern philosophies and a philosophical lens to view normally difficult to comprehend scientific theories through, is validation of my views and a real joy to read, while learning some new concepts (the exchange of "virtual" particles, mesons, pions... just to name a few).
              <br><br>
              So, needless to say, I've been in a bit of a physics nerd mindset the past week, which led me to some pandemic related musings and humor.
              <br><br>
              Firstly, I've been reminded of <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat">Schrödinger's cat</a> thought experiment in which a cat inside a box is simultaneously both alive and dead (aka quantum superposition) until the box is opened and the state of the cat is determined. In our current coronavirus world, every person is like Schrödinger's cat—until tested, we all simultaneously both have and do not have the virus! We are all in a quantum state of superposition! How cool is that?
              <br><br>
              Secondly, we all (well, most of us anyway) are experiencing another quantum phenomena—the restlessness of subatomic particles, which shows that the smaller the area of confinement, the more restless a particle will become, and the more velocity it will move around with. Here is the excerpt from The Tao of Physics, pages 213-215:
              <br><br>
              "Whenever a subatomic particle is confined to a small region of space, it reacts to this confinement by moving around. The smaller the region of confinement, the faster the particle will 'jiggle' around in it. This behavior is a typical 'quantum effect', a feature of the subatomic world which has no macroscopic analogy... The tendency of particles to react to confinement with motion implies a fundamental 'restlessness' of matter which is characteristic of the subatomic world."
              <br><br>
              Please bring your attention to the "feature of the subatomic world which has no macroscopic analogy" line and rejoice with me in discovering that we as humans are the macroscopic analogy! Have you ever felt so restless as you have the past week, being stuck at home in self-isolation, even though we're being handed all the time to do the things we've been longing to do instead of working?! And I can reasonably bet that the smaller your home or apartment, the more restless you are (I say this with experience coming from my 400 square feet or 37 square meters apartment).
              <br><br>
              So these have been my coronavirus musings. Stay healthy and stay curious everyone! If there is one thing to remember from the wisdom of Eastern philosophy and physics, it is that our universe is constantly in a state of flux, we are constantly in a state of flux, and even the most seemingly static objects in our universe are alive and full of energy, just as we are alive and full of energy no matter how "stuck" we may feel during this time.

              It's been a couple of weeks since I wrote. I'm currently in the middle of a book, <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/the-code-book-how-to-make-it-break-it-hack-it-crack-it_simon-singh/254038/item/1638901/">The Code Book</a>, and I plan on giving a more detailed analysis once I'm done. But so far, it is excellent! I remember being a kid and coming up with ciphers to write secret notes with, and this book takes me right back to that innocent time in my life. I just finished the chapter on breaking the Enigma during World War II, and the book will finish with data encryption as we know it today.
              <br><br>
              But, the real reason I feel like writing today is to share some comics I was introduced to on New Year's Eve, and which have become a bit of a late night addiction for me. I've found myself laughing uncontrollably at these simple depictions of human life through aliens with a more precise form of the English language. The kind of laughter where I finally stop, tears in my eyes, but then like the hiccups when there's still some residual energy left in your stomach, a single thought sets me off again. Hope you enjoy a few of my favorites, and maybe be prompted to find some of your own! Without further ado... Strange Planet by Nathan W. Pyle...

            <p class="copy">
              On my commute into work today I listened to this TED Talk on <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/craig_costello_in_the_war_for_information_will_quantum_computers_defeat_cryptographers?language=en">quantum computing and cryptography</a> and wanted to share. As with every technological advancement, there is always the dark side to balance along with all of the wonderful possibilities. Quantum computers, while they have the potential to solve incredible, and even unfathomable problems for us, will come at a price—and that price is quite possibly our secrets and security.
              <br><br>
              I personally wasn't worried about this. I have complete faith that while the physicists, mathematicians, and engineers are working on quantum computers, physicists, mathematicians, and engineers are simultaneously working on the cryptography problems, so that when quantum computers become available secure quantum encryption will exist as well. I saw the two as working together, like when two competing athletes push each other to higher levels of performance through their very competition—with an advancement in one comes a parallel advancement in the other. Vikram Sharma addresses this in an equally informative TED Talk on <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/vikram_sharma_how_quantum_physics_can_make_encryption_stronger#t-182188">how quantum physics is making encryption stronger</a>.
              <br><br>
              But what I hadn't considered is pointed out by Craig Costello in the first TED Talk just mentioned—what about all of the data that has been encrypted in the past and is currently being encrypted and stored? What will happen to those secrets?
            </p>

          <div class="blog-entry">
            <p class="entry-date">February 10, 2020</p>
            <p class="copy">
              During the past (nearly) 5 years at the company I work at, <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://happy.co/" >HappyCo</a>, I've watched us go through some major milestones going from a startup working out of a closet in the back of a gym in San Francisco, to a profitable enterprise SaaS company with employees across 4 countries. I remember when we weren't even using Jira to track bugs and feature requests. Someone from the exec team would usually just tap an engineer on the shoulder as ask, "Can you build this?" or "Can you fix this?" I remember when we didn't write tests, or have code reviews. Those new features asked for by the execs were lucky if they got deployed once a month.
              <br><br>
              Now, 4 years after hiring our Director of Engineering, our engineering team is bigger than the whole company when I started. We deploy several times a week if not daily, write unit and integration tests for every piece of code, and have a QA team to catch the UI bugs us engineers and our tests have missed. We use Jira and Asana for feature and bug tracking. We use <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.gerritcodereview.com/">Gerrit</a> that requires multiple code reviews and a passing score from <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a>. We've added 3 new client-facing products, and have design and product teams helping us deliver the features and products that clients really want and need.
              <br><br>
              In true agile fashion, we've not only revised our products and processes, but we've iterated on team structure several times as we've grown. When we were just a few engineers, we didn't have sprints or standups. But once we grew a little bit, we all attended an agile/scrum training. We started having quarterly planning sessions, 2 week sprints, and daily standups. But then we grew a little bit more and had 2 teams, 1 in the US and 1 in Australia (with workdays starting 7.5 and 5.5 hours apart depending what time of year we were in, and Mondays and Fridays seeing only a single team online). So each team had their own standup, and very little work that was committed to being finished in 2 weeks was actually getting finished due to the extra long cycle times since it was difficult to get code reviews and code re-works done in a timely fashion.
              <br><br>
              So we scrapped the 2 week sprints altogether and moved to 10 weeks sprints with a single daily standup including both teams and 2 retros each term. This worked for awhile, but then we grew again. At this point, our DoE needed help managing all of the engineers, so we split into 2 distinct teams (this is when I moved to Australia to lead one of the teams). Our metrics went up—velocity, cycle time, story points done per term, etc. We were on a roll. Had we finally found the secret sauce?
              <br><br>
              Not quite. To remain flexible, we changed from 10 week terms to 8 week terms, broke into 5 streams (not teams), scrapped daily standups altogether, and reduced the retros to once a term. So far this is working out well, with each stream focusing on a product objective, like our newest product, or integrations, or tech debt.
              <br><br>
              So why am I telling you all this? Because I personally find the unique approaches of different engineering teams to be valuable. There's no right way to structure a team or plan work—across different companies, or in a single one. We're all agile teams (at least, it's 2020 and I'm assuming so). Which means that we need to be agile and flexible and constantly revising and reiterating on our products and ourselves. The more we find out about how other teams are doing it, we can get ideas for how to revise what isn't working in our own team, and possibly try something new.
              <br><br>
              Even if there is no one right way to do things, I will leave you with this resource though, which I've personally enjoyed reading. It's about the <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/">12 aspects of an engineering team</a> that can help determine if the way you're doing things is at least on the right track. Maybe not perfect, but progressing in the right direction. Enjoy!

              Another short entry. This time I will share another short list—of some of my favorite nerds and companies doing incredible things in technology!
              <br><br>
              <b>Elon Musk</b>... need I say more? Of course we all know about Tesla and SpaceX, but what really got me interested in his ideas was living in South Australia and experiencing some of the energy crisis that affects the state (electricity costs on average 5x more there than it does in San Francisco and was prone to day+ long blackouts in the extremely hot summer months, which often lead to deaths, mostly of the elderly). Elon committed to help solve this issue by bringing a gigantic Tesla battery to the state, which succeeded ahead of schedule. You can read more about the feat <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/world/australia/elon-musk-south-australia-battery.html">here</a>.
              <br>
              Another company of his that is doing extraordinary, albeit controversial, things is <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.neuralink.com/">Neuralink</a>. The company is developing <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/16/20697123/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-reading-thread-robot">brain sensor implants and a robot to do the surgery</a> that will allow people with disabilities and injuries the ability to control computers with their thoughts. A technology that in the wrong hands sounds like something out of Black Mirror, The Matrix, or Brave New World, but is undoubtably a fascinating leap towards giving paralyzed patients new possibilities.
              <br><br>
              <b>Stephen Wolfram</b>, creator of <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a> and <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/">Wolfram Alpha</a> is one of my new idols after reading <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/computational-law-symbolic-discourse-and-the-ai-constitution/">this article</a> about his ideas for creating a new kind of computer language that contains symbolic representations of everything we humans have knowledge of. Stephen says that the language is "a bridge between the precision of traditional computer languages and the ability to talk about real-world constructs." If you haven't noticed, I'm a big fan of bridges! Especially when that bridge involves language and communication and technology.
              <br>
              Stephen has many other ideas and projects worth exploring. Here's a great TED talk where he introduces his ideas around <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/stephen_wolfram_computing_a_theory_of_all_knowledge">computing a theory of all knowledge</a>.
              <br><br>
              Now I'm a little hesitant to mention this other one... but please suspend all judgement until I mention the specific project that gets my neurdons excited. <b>Google</b> and their breakthrough in quantum computing.
              <br>
              I first got interested in quantum computing when I read a dystopian trilogy in which the government is using a quantum computer run on the minds of gifted people called travelers who can use their minds to exist in multiple places at once (if you're interested, the first book in the trilogy is <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Traveler-John-Twelve-Hawks/dp/1400079292">The Traveler</a>). Clearly a fictional story with a lot of layered ideas that wouldn't actually go together in the real world, but it got me wondering about quantum computers and where we were at with developing the technology, and how it works.
              <br>
              In my (ironic) Googling on the subject, according to Google, they have made huge strides in "quantum supremacy" and have successfully run an algorithm that would have taken a supercomputer 10,000 years to complete—in 200 seconds! Check out one of the many articles <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03213-z">here</a>. As with most technological breakthroughs, there's a lot of skepticism around Google's claim, but I find it fascinating nonetheless.

              Just a quick entry today to list off some of the books I have read over the past year.
              <br><br>
              Books that are pertinent to programming:
              <br><br>
              <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Geek-Sublime-Beauty-Code/dp/1555976859">Geek Sublime</a> is a personal all time favorite! It was published by an English professor at UC Berkeley where I graduated from. I had taken a photo of the book when it was listed on the bulletin board of faculty publishings (this was back when I was purely a writer and knew nothing of coding, but the title had caught my eye). A couple of years later, after I had started my career as an engineer, I came across the photo in my photo stream and bought it immediately. A book about the art and aesthetics of coding, this book voiced everything I had been abstractly thinking about, but didn't quite have the language to express. The author, Vikram Chandra, is an English professor and a professional programmer, and a newfound hero of mine.
              <br><br>
              <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-John-Ousterhout/dp/1732102201/">A Philosophy of Software Design</a> by John Ousterhout (a professor at Stanford) filled in a lot of the gaps for me about how to think about writing software. Since I didn't get a CS degree, but instead went to a bootcamp to learn how to code, I didn't get to study the theories and science behind programming. If you did, you might find the concepts in this book redundant or obvious, but as someone who didn't get that education, I found it to be a valuable book to read.
              <br><br>
              <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://umich.instructure.com/files/884126/download?download_frd=1">The Mythical Man-Month</a> comes up on almost every recommended reading list for engineers, and with good reason. It's a short essay, not a full book, that outlines why adding more engineers to a behind-deadline project never works in our favour.
              <br><br>
              <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Life-Code-Personal-History-Technology/dp/0374534519">Life in Code</a> and <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Close-Machine-Technophilia-Its-Discontents/dp/1250002486/">Close to the Machine</a> by Ellen Ullman are collections of short stories about Ellen's decades of work as a programmer in San Francisco. Her stories are both insightful looks under the cultural covers of the area and industry, and wildly hilarious. She is also a novelist—I've read all of her books, and she is one of my favorite authors. But her auto-biographical non-fiction stories are unparalleled in comparison to her other books. (Although I will admit that I have a bias towards true stories. Even as a young child I didn't like cartoons because they "weren't real life").
              <br><br>
              Some other personal favorites that have deepened my knowledge of life:
              <br><br>
              <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Edge-Infinity-Encounters-Beauty-Universe/dp/1788400607">On the Edge of Infinity</a> by Stefan Klein is a beautifully written book about the universe that bridges a poetic outlook of awe and wonder with scientific theories in astronomy and physics. We may not be able to explain everything about our universe, as many theories fall short or seem to be rendered incompatible with newfound knowledge, but we can still experience the splendor and mystery of this vast universe we call home.
              <br><br>
              <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens/">Sapiens</a> by Yuval Noah Harari is 'a brief history of humankind' that maps the various evolutions and revolutions of the various human species since we appeared on this planet. Bridging all things human—consciousness, language, math, science, law, religion, society, migration, technology, and more—if you have any interest in our past, present, or future, I highly recommend this book!

          <div class="blog-entry">
            <p class="entry-date">February 4, 2020</p>
            <p class="copy">When I moved back to San Francisco after living and working in Adelaide, South Australia, our Director of Engineering suggested that I start a blog to keep in touch with the engineering team that I would be 8,069 miles/12,987 kilometers from. To write down what I was learning and exploring. I had started this website and a blog 5 years ago when I was at Dev Bootcamp, so instead of creating a new blog, I decided to revise my old site.
            <br><br>
            So, what have I been exploring in regards to my job?
            <br><br>
            <b>Concurrency</b>
            <br>
            Firstly, our backend at work is written in Go. Having come from a bootcamp where I initially learned Ruby on Rails, this was a big shift for me 4 years ago when I first started learning Go, but I have come to love it as a language. I can code in Go mostly-fluently now, but was recently asked by a friend to explain why our company decided to use Go. I began to talk about concurrency, but after floundering around a bit trying to synthesize my mental impressions of concurrency and our particular business needs into coherent sentences, I decided to do some reading to solidify my understanding. I quickly discovered that I had been conflating 2 different "concurrencies". There is the concurrent updates problem that something like Google Docs has to solve for using the Operational Transformation algorithm, and then there is concurrency in Go, which allows for multiple functions to run without waiting for the preceding functions to finish. The following resources proved quite valuable to me in clearing up this confusion:
            <br>
            <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@srijancse/how-real-time-collaborative-editing-work-operational-transformation-ac4902d75682">Operational Transformation</a>
            <br>
            <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://mindbowser.com/golang-concurrency/">Golang Concurrency</a>
            <br><br>
            <b>Docker and Kubernetes</b>
            <br>
            Secondly, I am happy to announce that I finally (think I) understand what Docker is! I've read these docs a few times, but didn't quite get it. I knew that it always booted up when I turned on my computer, and had Kubernetes pods and containers that contained things, and images that were copies of things, but the words didn't synthesize into real meaning. But finally it has clicked. An image is a copy of all the files that are needed to run a service (a copy of the code that I touch on a daily basis). A container is a single service that runs from the code in the image (think microservices). And a pod is group of containers, aka services, that make up an application running on a host. * If you are reading this and my newfound understanding is wrong or incomplete, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'd hate to promote incorrect information, but this is how Docker is working in my mind. For further reading, the docs are an excellent place to start:
            <br>
            <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/">Docker Docs</a>
            <br><br>
            Concurrency and containers are useful and all, but what really gets me personally excited as of late?
            <br><br>
            <b>Code Parties!</b>
            <br>
            What better way to bridge arts and tech than to make music with code?! Check out the article about last year's live coding party - <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/story/algoraves-live-coding-djs/">DJs of the Future Don't Spin Records—They Write Code</a>. Unfortunately, I will not be in San Francisco when the next one happens at <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://aaassembly.org/">Algorithmic Art Assembly</a>, but this really gets my neurdons firing!
            <br><br>
            <b>Spotify</b>
            <br>
            Ok, I know, I know. I'm an (extremely) latecomer on the Spotify scene. I didn't make the switch from Pandora to Spotify until I moved to Australia where Pandora wasn't available. But I was immediately in love and have spent many hours making playlists and pondering about the algorithms and AI models that must be making Spotify awesome. If you do the same, here is an article for your reading pleasure - <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://qz.com/571007/the-magic-that-makes-spotifys-discover-weekly-playlists-so-damn-good/">The magic that makes Spotify’s Discover Weekly playlists so damn good</a> (yes, it was written in 2015, so I'm very, very late to the scene, but better late than never).
            <br><br>
            The list of books and articles that keep me up late at night and put a smile on my face early in the morning is extensive, so I will leave this post here for now. To be continued...

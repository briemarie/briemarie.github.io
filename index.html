              Wow, I'm only getting worse at this regularly blogging thing—it has officially been a full month since I last wrote. Given the current state of global affairs, I'm sure you'll forgive me though, especially considering that I was traveling around as a self-isolating nomad for two of the past few weeks. As uncertain as traveling around was (I drove 3000 miles, or 4828 kilometers, in 10 days), I was two weeks ahead of the self-isolation measures imposed on us here in California, and was doing it in the most beauitful way possible—seeing five states worth of majestic scenery pass around me as I listened to one of my favourite podcasts, <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/">The Knowledge Project</a>, and streamed hours of fantastic beats (thanks again, Spotify)!
              <br><br>
              But here I am, "settled" and "statically" isolating, ready to start blogging again. The feeling of my fingers typing is bringing me much joy, and the clickity-clack of the keys is a familiar melody that I didn't realize how much I missed. So here it goes, my current covid 19 musings...
              <br><br>
              As a preface, you should know that I am currently reading <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tao_of_Physics">The Tao of Physics (Third Edition)</a> by Fritjof Capra and am absolutely loving it. The parallels between Eastern philosophies and physics, namely quantum mechanics, is beauitful to behold. As a meditator, I have felt for many years the interconnectedness of all things and events, and have attributed my understanding of theories of the multiverse, quantum entanglement, and superposition to my meditation practice and the states of consciousness I have reached through it. To read a book that gives scientific evidence to Eastern philosophies and a philosophical lens to view normally difficult to comprehend scientific theories through, is validation of my views and a real joy to read, while learning some new concepts (the exchange of "virtual" particles, mesons, pions... just to name a few).
              <br><br>
              So, needless to say, I've been in a bit of a physics nerd mindset the past week, which led me to some pandemic related musings and humor.
              <br><br>
              Firstly, I've been reminded of <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat">Schrödinger's cat</a> thought experiment in which a cat inside a box is simultaneously both alive and dead (aka quantum superposition) until the box is opened and the state of the cat is determined. In our current covid 19 world, every person is like Schrödinger's cat—until tested, we all simultaneously both have and do not have the virus! We are all in a quantum state of superposition! How cool is that?
              <br><br>
              Secondly, we all (well, most of us anyway) are experiencing another quantum phenomena—the restlessness of subatomic particles, which shows that the smaller the area of confinement, the more restless a particle will become, and the more velocity it will move around with. Here is the excerpt from The Tao of Physics, pages 213-215:
              <br><br>
              "Whenever a subatomic particle is confined to a small region of space, it reacts to this confinement by moving around. The smaller the region of confinement, the faster the particle will 'jiggle' around in it. This behavior is a typical 'quantum effect', a feature of the subatomic world which has no macroscopic analogy... The tendency of particles to react to confinement with motion implies a fundamental 'restlessness' of matter which is characteristic of the subatomic world."
              <br><br>
              Please bring your attention to the "feature of the subatomic world which has no macroscopic analogy" line and rejoice with me in discovering that we as humans are the macroscopic analogy! Have you ever felt so restless as you have the past week, being stuck at home in self-isolation, even though we're being handed all the time to do the things we've been longing to do instead of working?! And I can reasonably bet that the smaller your home or apartment, the more restless you are (I say this with experience coming from my 400 square feet or 37 square meters apartment).
              <br><br>
              So these have been my covid 19 musings. Stay healthy and stay curious everyone! If there is one thing to remember from the wisdom of Eastern philosophy and physics, it is that our universe is constantly in a state of flux, we are constantly in a state of flux, and even the most seemingly static objects in our universe are alive and full of energy, just as we are alive and full of energy no matter how "stuck" we may feel during this time.

              It's been a couple of weeks since I wrote. I'm currently in the middle of a book, <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/the-code-book-how-to-make-it-break-it-hack-it-crack-it_simon-singh/254038/item/1638901/">The Code Book</a>, and I plan on giving a more detailed analysis once I'm done. But so far, it is excellent! I remember being a kid and coming up with ciphers to write secret notes with, and this book takes me right back to that innocent time in my life. I just finished the chapter on breaking the Enigma during World War II, and the book will finish with data encryption as we know it today.
              <br><br>
              But, the real reason I feel like writing today is to share some comics I was introduced to on New Year's Eve, and which have become a bit of a late night addiction for me. I've found myself laughing uncontrollably at these simple depictions of human life through aliens with a more precise form of the English language. The kind of laughter where I finally stop, tears in my eyes, but then like the hiccups when there's still some residual energy left in your stomach, a single thought sets me off again. Hope you enjoy a few of my favorites, and maybe be prompted to find some of your own! Without further ado... Strange Planet by Nathan W. Pyle...

            <p class="copy">
              On my commute into work today I listened to this TED Talk on <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/craig_costello_in_the_war_for_information_will_quantum_computers_defeat_cryptographers?language=en">quantum computing and cryptography</a> and wanted to share. As with every technological advancement, there is always the dark side to balance along with all of the wonderful possibilities. Quantum computers, while they have the potential to solve incredible, and even unfathomable problems for us, will come at a price—and that price is quite possibly our secrets and security.
              <br><br>
              I personally wasn't worried about this. I have complete faith that while the physicists, mathematicians, and engineers are working on quantum computers, physicists, mathematicians, and engineers are simultaneously working on the cryptography problems, so that when quantum computers become available secure quantum encryption will exist as well. I saw the two as working together, like when two competing athletes push each other to higher levels of performance through their very competition—with an advancement in one comes a parallel advancement in the other. Vikram Sharma addresses this in an equally informative TED Talk on <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/vikram_sharma_how_quantum_physics_can_make_encryption_stronger#t-182188">how quantum physics is making encryption stronger</a>.
              <br><br>
              But what I hadn't considered is pointed out by Craig Costello in the first TED Talk just mentioned—what about all of the data that has been encrypted in the past and is currently being encrypted and stored? What will happen to those secrets?
            </p>

          <div class="blog-entry">
            <p class="entry-date">February 10, 2020</p>
            <p class="copy">
              During the past (nearly) 5 years at the company I work at, <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://happy.co/" >HappyCo</a>, I've watched us go through some major milestones going from a startup working out of a closet in the back of a gym in San Francisco, to a profitable enterprise SaaS company with employees across 4 countries. I remember when we weren't even using Jira to track bugs and feature requests. Someone from the exec team would usually just tap an engineer on the shoulder as ask, "Can you build this?" or "Can you fix this?" I remember when we didn't write tests, or have code reviews. Those new features asked for by the execs were lucky if they got deployed once a month.
              <br><br>
              Now, 4 years after hiring our Director of Engineering, our engineering team is bigger than the whole company when I started. We deploy several times a week if not daily, write unit and integration tests for every piece of code, and have a QA team to catch the UI bugs us engineers and our tests have missed. We use Jira and Asana for feature and bug tracking. We use <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.gerritcodereview.com/">Gerrit</a> that requires multiple code reviews and a passing score from <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a>. We've added 3 new client-facing products, and have design and product teams helping us deliver the features and products that clients really want and need.
              <br><br>
              In true agile fashion, we've not only revised our products and processes, but we've iterated on team structure serveral times as we've grown. When we were just a few engineers, we didn't have sprints or standups. But once we grew a little bit, we all attended an agile/scrum training. We started having quarterly planning sessions, 2 week sprints, and daily standups. But then we grew a little bit more and had 2 teams, 1 in the US and 1 in Australia (with workdays starting 7.5 and 5.5 hours apart depending what time of year we were in, and Mondays and Fridays seeing only a single team online). So each team had their own standup, and very little work that was commited to being finished in 2 weeks was actually getting finished due to the extra long cycle times since it was difficult to get code reviews and code re-works done in a timely fashion.
              <br><br>
              So we scrapped the 2 week sprints altogther and moved to 10 weeks sprints with a single daily standup including both teams and 2 retros each term. This worked for awhile, but then we grew again. At this point, our DoE needed help managing all of the engineers, so we split into 2 distinct teams (this is when I moved to Australia to lead one of the teams). Our metrics went up—velocity, cycle time, story points done per term, etc. We were on a roll. Had we finally found the secret sauce?
              <br><br>
              Not quite. To remain flexible, we changed from 10 week terms to 8 week terms, broke into 5 streams (not teams), scrapped daily standups altogether, and reduced the retros to once a term. So far this is working out well, with each stream focusing on a product objective, like our newest product, or integrations, or tech debt.
              <br><br>
              So why am I telling you all this? Because I personally find the unique approaches of different engineering teams to be valuable. There's no right way to structure a team or plan work—across different companies, or in a single one. We're all agile teams (at least, it's 2020 and I'm assuming so). Which means that we need to be agile and flexible and constantly revising and reiterating on our products and ourselves. The more we find out about how other teams are doing it, we can get ideas for how to revise what isn't working in our own team, and possibly try something new.
              <br><br>
              Even if there is no one right way to do things, I will leave you with this resource though, which I've personally enjoyed reading. It's about the <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/">12 aspects of an engineering team</a> that can help determine if the way you're doing things is at least on the right track. Maybe not perfect, but progressing in the right direction. Enjoy!

              Another short entry. This time I will share another short list—of some of my favorite nerds and companies doing incredible things in technology!
              <br><br>
              <b>Elon Musk</b>... need I say more? Of course we all know about Tesla and SpaceX, but what really got me interested in his ideas was living in South Australia and experiencing some of the energy crisis that affects the state (electricity costs on average 5x more there than it does in San Francisco and was prone to day+ long blackouts in the extremely hot summer months, which often lead to deaths, mostly of the elderly). Elon committed to help solve this issue by bringing a gigantic Tesla battery to the state, which succeeded ahead of schedule. You can read more about the feat <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/world/australia/elon-musk-south-australia-battery.html">here</a>.
              <br>
              Another company of his that is doing extrordinay, albeit controversial, things is <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.neuralink.com/">Neuralink</a>. The company is developing <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/16/20697123/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-reading-thread-robot">brain sensor implants and a robot to do the surgery</a> that will allow people with disabiities and injuries the ability to control computers with their thoughts. A technology that in the wrong hands sounds like something out of Black Mirror, The Matrix, or Brave New World, but is undoubtably a fascinating leap towards giving paralyzed patients new possibilities.
              <br><br>
              <b>Stephen Wolfram</b>, creator of <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a> and <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/">Wolfram Alpha</a> is one of my new idols after reading <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/computational-law-symbolic-discourse-and-the-ai-constitution/">this article</a> about his ideas for creating a new kind of computer language that contains symbolic representations of everything we humans have knowledge of. Stephen says that the language is "a bridge between the precision of traditional computer languages and the ability to talk about real-world constructs." If you haven't noticed, I'm a big fan of bridges! Especially when that bridge involves language and communication and technology.
              <br>
              Stephen has many other ideas and projects worth exploring. Here's a great TED talk where he introduces his ideas around <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/stephen_wolfram_computing_a_theory_of_all_knowledge">computing a theory of all knowledge</a>.
              <br><br>
              Now I'm a little hesitant to mention this other one... but please suspend all judgement until I mention the specific project that gets my neurdons excited. <b>Google</b> and their breakthrough in quantum computing.
              <br>
              I first got interested in quantum computing when I read a dystopian trilogy in which the government is using a quantum computer run on the minds of gifted people called travelers who can use their minds to exist in multiple places at once (if you're interested, the first book in the trilogy is <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Traveler-John-Twelve-Hawks/dp/1400079292">The Traveler</a>). Clearly a fictional story with a lot of layered ideas that wouldn't actually go together in the real world, but it got me wondering about quantum computers and where we were at with developing the technology, and how it works.
              <br>
              In my (ironic) Googling on the subject, according to Google, they have made huge strides in "quantum supremacy" and have successfully run an algorithm that would have taken a supercomputer 10,000 years to complete—in 200 seconds! Check out one of the many articles <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03213-z">here</a>. As with most technogical breakthroughs, there's a lot of skepticism around Google's claim, but I find it fascinating nonetheless.

            <p class="copy">
              Just a quick entry today to list off some of the books I have read over the past year.
              <br><br>
              Books that are pertinent to programming:
              <br><br>
              <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Geek-Sublime-Beauty-Code/dp/1555976859">Geek Sublime</a> is a personal all time favorite! It was published by an English professor at UC Berkeley where I graduated from. I had taken a photo of the book when it was listed on the bulletin board of faculty publishings (this was back when I was purely a writer and knew nothing of coding, but the title had caught my eye). A couple of years later, after I had started my career as an engineer, I came across the photo in my photo stream and bought it immediately. A book about the art and aesthetics of coding, this book voiced everything I had been abstractly thining about, but didn't quite have the language to express. The author, Vikram Chandra, is an English professor and a professional programmer, and a newfound hero of mine.
              <br><br>
              <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-John-Ousterhout/dp/1732102201/">A Philosophy of Software Design</a> by John Ousterhout (a professor at Stanford) filled in a lot of the gaps for me about how to think about writing software. Since I didn't get a CS degree, but instead went to a bootcamp to learn how to code, I didn't get to study the theories and science behind programming. If you did, you might find the concepts in this book redundant or obvious, but as someone who didn't get that education, I found it to be a valuable book to read.
              <br><br>
              <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://umich.instructure.com/files/884126/download?download_frd=1">The Mythical Man-Month</a> comes up on almost every recommended reading list for engineers, and with good reason. It's a short essay, not a full book, that outlines why adding more engineers to a behind-deadline project never works in our favour.
              <br><br>
              <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Life-Code-Personal-History-Technology/dp/0374534519">Life in Code</a> and <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Close-Machine-Technophilia-Its-Discontents/dp/1250002486/">Close to the Machine</a> by Ellen Ullman are collections of short stories about Ellen's decades of work as a programmer in San Francisco. Her stories are both insightful looks under the cultural covers of the area and industry, and wildly hilarious. She is also a novelist—I've read all of her books, and she is one of my favorite authors. But her auto-biographical non-fiction stories are unparalleled in comparison to her other books. (Although I will admit that I have a bias towards true stories. Even as a young child I didn't like cartoons because they "weren't real life").
              <br><br>
              Some other personal favorites that have deepened my knowledge of life:
              <br><br>
              <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Edge-Infinity-Encounters-Beauty-Universe/dp/1788400607">On the Edge of Infinity</a> by Stefan Klein is a beautifully written book about the universe that bridges a poetic outlook of awe and wonder with scientific theories in astronomy and physics. We may not be able to explain everything about our universe, as many theories fall short or seem to be rendered incompatible with newfound knowledge, but we can still experience the splendour and mystery of this vast universe we call home.
              <br><br>
              <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316117/">Sapiens</a> by Yuval Noah Harari is 'a brief history of humankind' that maps the various evolutions and revolutions of the various human species since we appeared on this planet. Bridging all things human—consciousness, langauge, math, science, law, religion, society, migration, technology, and more—if you have any interest in our past, present, or future, I highly recommend this book!

            <p class="entry-date">February 4, 2020</p>
            <p class="copy">When I moved back to San Francisco after living and working in Adelaide, South Australia, our Director of Engineering suggested that I start a blog to keep in touch with the engineering team that I would be 8,069 miles/12,987 kilometers from. To write down what I was learning and exploring. I had started this website and a blog 5 years ago when I was at Dev Bootcamp, so instead of creating a new blog, I decided to revise my old site.
            <br><br>
            So, what have I been exploring in regards to my job?
            <br><br>
            <b>Concurrency</b>
            <br>
            Firstly, our backend at work is written in Go. Having come from a bootcamp where I initially learned Ruby on Rails, this was a big shift for me 4 years ago when I first started learning Go, but I have come to love it as a language. I can code in Go mostly-fluently now, but was recently asked by a friend to explain why our company decided to use Go. I began to talk about concurrency, but after floundering around a bit trying to synthesize my mental impressions of concurrency and our particular business needs into coherent sentences, I decided to do some reading to solidify my understanding. I quickly discovered that I had been conflating 2 different "concurrencies". There is the concurrent updates problem that something like Google Docs has to solve for using the Operational Transformation algorithm, and then there is concurrency in Go, which allows for multiple functions to run without waiting for the preceeding functions to finish. The following resources proved quite valuable to me in clearing up this confusion:

            <b>Docker and Kubernetes</b>
            <br>
            Secondly, I am happy to announce that I finally (think I) understand what Docker is! I've read these docs a few times, but didn't quite get it. I knew that it always booted up when I turned on my computer, and had Kubernetes pods and containers that contained things, and images that were copies of things, but the words didn't synthesize into real meaning. But finally it has clicked. An image is a copy of all the files that are needed to run a service (a copy of the code that I touch on a daily basis). A container is a single service that runs from the code in the image (think microservices). And a pod is group of containers, aka services, that make up an application running on a host. * If you are reading this and my newfound understanding is wrong or incomplete, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'd hate to promote incorrect information, but this is how Docker is working in my mind. For further reading, the docs are an excellent place to start:

            <br><br>
            Concurrency and containers are useful and all, but what really gets me personally excited as of late?

            <b>Code Parties!</b>
            <br>
            What better way to bridge arts and tech than to make music with code?! Check out the article about last year's live coding party - <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/story/algoraves-live-coding-djs/">DJs of the Future Don't Spin Records—They Write Code</a>. Unfortunately, I will not be in San Francisco when the next one happens at <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://aaassembly.org/">Algorithmic Art Assembly</a>, but this really gets my neurdons firing!

            <b>Spotify</b>
            <br>
            Ok, I know, I know. I'm an (extremely) latecomer on the Spotify scene. I didn't make the switch from Pandora to Spotify until I moved to Australia where Pandora wasn't avaialable. But I was immediately in love and have spent many hours making playlists and pondering about the algorithms and AI models that must be making Spotify awesome. If you do the same, here is an article for your reading pleasure - <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://qz.com/571007/the-magic-that-makes-spotifys-discover-weekly-playlists-so-damn-good/">The magic that makes Spotify’s Discover Weekly playlists so damn good</a> (yes, it was written in 2015, so I'm very, very late to the scene, but better late than never).

            The list of books and articles that keep me up late at night and put a smile on my face early in the morning is extensive, so I will leave this post here for now. To be continued...

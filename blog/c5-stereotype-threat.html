<h2> Stereo[type] Threat  <br />
  <span> October 21, 2014 </span></h2>

<div>
<p> Stereotype threat is a term coined by Dr. Claude Steele that explains the underperformance of certain groups of people in situations where they feel the pressure of their identity playing a role in the outcome of the situation. He uses an example of an experiment conducted that show women who generally excel at math being given a math test in which they are  told that the test is known to show the difference between men and women's abilities in math. He also uses various examples about the effects of race identity in given situations. The conclusion is that it is those who are the most invested in the outcome who perform the worst under stereotype threat because they are essentially trying so hard not to confirm the stereotype, that they put detrimental amounts of stress upon themsleves and perform badly. </p>
<p> In my personal experience, out of the many common social identities that one could hold, the only one that I feel I actually apply to myself is being female. As a kid growing up, I was a tomboy and loved playing sports in the street with my dad, brother, and neighborhood boys. Nobody ever seemed to mind the fact that I was a girl, and I was good, especially at football. But then by the time I entered middle school, the fact that I was a girl did start to become an issue for the boys. They would gang up on me and not let me play, never telling me exactly that I couldn't play, but the ball would never get passed to me, or the puck, as I fell in love with street hockey. This usually only happened when certain boys were around, but even when they weren't, and I was playing and having a good time with the boys who didn't mind that I was a girl, I was suddenly becoming worse. I couldn't score, I missed the puck a lot, I tripped more often, and generally stopped having a good time, which eventually led me to stop playing altogether. I never consciously believed that any lack of skill was because I was a girl, but I did feel the pressure to be even better than the boys so I could prove I belonged in the game. When I saw myself not proving this, I slowly lost interest in even trying to join the game. Now I know that this feeling has an actual theoretical name- Stereotype Threat. I was feeling that I was proving I didn't belong, so I stopped trying, and made the excuse that I had lost interest in the game, but really the stress of trying to go beyond a stereotype caused me to quit so that the threat of reinforcing the stereotype would go away. </p>
<p> Acedemically, which is what Dr. Steele focuses on, I can't say I've ever felt Stereotype Threat. I excelled at math in high school naturally, and never felt the pressure to excel just because I was female. In college psychology and English lit were my focus, two subjects that are stereotypically subjects that women tend to excel in anyway, so I definitely didn't feel the pressure to disprove a negative stereotype there. Now that I am entering into the tech field though, I am entering into a negatively stereotyped area for women. However, I can't say that I feel the pressure, yet. This may be because right now there is a bg focus on getting more women into the industry, so I feel the stereotypes are being broken down already around me and I don't have anything to prove, I'm just happy to be a part of the progress. Or maybe its because so far at DBC we are only in phase 0, so I am not around the predominantly male cohort comparing my skills to theirs. Or maybe its because I talk to some of the guys at DBC who are just as worried about not being on par with the program, so I am seeing that perceived success really has nothing to do with being female or male. Whatever it is, I think mainataining exactly what I just expressed is the key to overcoming Stereotype Threat- knowing and believing the fact that everyone is in the same boat and somewhere in the learning curve, regardless of being male or female. I think something else that will help if I ever do start to feel the pressure, is reminding myself that this is not a competition- its not a competition between myself and other individuals, or between my gender/sex and another gender/sex. I am here to do my personal best, and if any pressure occurs, it should be me trying to prove to myself that I can excel at something I hadn't thought I could excel at. Its me against me, not me against negative stereotypes.

<h2> Feedback: Its what's for Breakfast  <br />
  <span> October 18, 2014 </span></h2>

<div>
<p> Well this week's topic is a little surprising. Here at DBC we have to reflect on everything that we do, and we have to give others feedback about how they do in our pairing sessions, we have to give feedback on other people's feedback, and now we have to blog about feedback... I'm thinking feedback is only mildly important to DBC... : D<br/>
All sarcasm aside, I actually really enjoy this aspect of the program. In a setting where I don't interact face to face with instructors (at least not yet in phase 0), and most of my interactions with other students are via unreliant Comcast and TimeWarner internet connections (kind of crazy to think that these two companies run the whole internet and cable connections of the US, but that is a tangent), aside from my own personal accomplishments through completing challenges, I have no idea how I'm actually progressing. Am I on par with other students? Do they feel held back while in pairing sessions with me? Am I living up to the standards of DBC's culture of empathy and tenacity? Are others going to enjoy being around me when we are actually together 9-15 hours a day for 9 weeks straight?? Without opportunites to pair program and then receive feedback about those sessions, I would have no idea how I was doing. And better yet, most of the feedback comes from other students. When I was attending Cal, the only feedback I got was from professors in the form of A-F grades- not exactly helpful. And usually by the time we got our grades back, the next paper was due a week later, and that is not enough time if I realized after getting my paper back that I was needing to improve in certain areas of essay writing. And then exams- one final at the end of the semester, testing me if I knew the whole semester of work. Not exactly a system that leaves room for much improvement. Here at DBC though, I get the opportunity to improve my critical thinking skills, social skills, emotional stability skills, empathy skills, critical response skills, and much more on a daily to weekly basis.</p>
<p> I have to keep these positives in mind every time I go into another pairing session, because no matter how many I do, they are still nerve wracking. I've come to know a few people, and know that our learning styles mesh well for pairing, but when pairing with a new person I always wonder if I'm going to hold them back, are they going to carry the team? Will I be able to give any useful solutions? I've come to realize that pairing is a huge challenge in itself for me, aside from the actual challenge we're faced with solving. I like to stay in my head, and follow problems through the labyrinth of my thoughts. I like to experiment as I go, and I like to set problems aside, read and research for awhile when I get stuck, then come back to the actual coding. I enjoy silence while coding, I don't even listen to music (although I am right now because this is blogging, not coding, and what can I say, Phutureprimitive Radio after midnight on a Saturday just gets my intuitive writer side going). But when I'm pairing, not only am I having to listen and stay focused on what someone else is saying, I'm having to talk, and try to focus on what to say. I know I seem wordy in my blog posts, but honestly talking about problems and how I'm thinking about solving them is one of the most foreign feelings to me. I'm extremely introverted when it comes to problem solving and study habits. I never did group study sessions, or even studied in the library, or at cafes the way the other students in college did. I had to be in my room, door closed, no distractions. Now with pair programming my mind is being forced to focus in so many ways at once- focus on the other person's thought process while trying to map mine, while trying to focus on what they are saying, while trying to respond, while looking at code and reading side material, while sometimes being watched by a guide... it makes my head spin just thinking about it.</p>
<p> One thing I have enjoyed about pairing though is pairing in person. It is so much easier when we aren't trying to screen share and deal with internet cuts and audio going out or video freezing. Because of this, I know I am going to enjoy pair programming at DBC's immersive program much more, and actually can't wait to be coding out of my tiny apartment which I've been hermited in for the past 5 weeks. <br />
  Another positive thing is that I know from the feedback I've received that I don't actually come off as awkward as I feel while pairing. All the feedback I've received has been right on par with what I expected to hear. The sessions where I was confident in my knowledge and skills, were scored higher in the benefitted technically category, and then other times when my pair was clearly more knowledgeable I scored around the neutral range. I am happy to see that I've consistently scored high in the culture and respect aspects of the feedback. As far as what people have told me specifically in feedback, its mostly in regards to my known weaknessess- mostly to become more familiar with the methods and syntax, and to not be nervous. I've recieved lots of feedback in regards to having great communication skills, so that's awesome to hear when I feel like communicating my thoughts is such a challenge. Overall, everyone has been really KIND, ACTIONABLE, and SPECIFIC, and I really appreciate the time they've put into pairing with me, helping me understand concepts better, and then giving me feedback. I think the feedback aspect of the program is what makes it special- we become a community of students, helping each other progress and not letting each other fall behind- its about accountability and community and that's really amazing.</p>
  <p> In addition to receiving feedback, I've had to write feedback for others, and usually this is a bit of a struggle. I always know what to say in regards to the positive aspects, but usually I get stuck on how to give actionable feedback, especially when my pair clearly carried the team. How do I tell someone else they need to improve, when I feel I am the one who needs the most improvement? That I have to say is the biggest struggle I have with giving feedback. Being SPECIFIC, no problem. Being KIND, that's easy. Being ACTIONABLE... well I have an actionable note to self- improve at writing actionable fedback.</p>

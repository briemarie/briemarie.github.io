<h2> I'm going off the RAILS on a crazy train...  <br />
  <span> November 5, 2014 </span></h2>

<div>
<p> I think this is actually a first- starting off with a tanget, but hey, I just had to throw in a good 'ol Ozzy reference when speaking about Rails. Yes, I capitalized it, because I am here to talk about Rails, as in Ruby on Rails. Throughout DBC we have been learning the coding language Ruby, and I've been wondering, "What is the Rails part?" I've even had friends ask me,"What is Rails if Ruby is the language, is it an environment?" I didn't quite know how to answer, because all I knew was it was a framework. I probably should have read more into it sooner, but with all the material at DBC, I figured I would get to it when we got to it. It was a framework, and I would be learning it was good enough for the time being, I mean, I wasn't even sure I could get through the Ruby part. But here I am, a week and a half away from staring phase 1, and this is definitely a good time to learn what Rails is.</p>
<p> From what I researched, Rails is a set of good practice guidelines for writing code in Ruby. But not just guidelines as in suggestions, more like an extra set of rules that are expected to be followed so all programmers are on the same page about how to write programs. I've experienced it here at DBC- there are many way to interpret challenges and most of us come up with different solutions. Inevitably, some are better than others as far as good practice habits, readability, length, and bugginess goes. So Rails, like a railing that guides a walker down a set of steep stairs, guides programmers safely through the language coding process, setting up a framework to ensure that the programmer isn't just making up what they think is best, but what actually is best.This helps not only the programmer writing the code, but also the future programmers who will need to read the code, expand the code, or fix bugs in it.</p>
<p> The Rails framework goes pretty deep- three layers deep to be exact. The Rails framework is based on the Model-View-Controller pattern, which divides a program into three interconnected parts-the model layer, the controller layer, and the view layer. The reason Ruby is on Rails, is because Ruby is excellent for building apps, and the MVC is used for building web apps that are very user (and programmer) friendly. Rails uses the MVC, along with some other useful tools, and brings it all to Ruby coders to ensure higher productivity and code managability. So, unlike Ozzy, this isn't a crazy train afterall, and I don't know about you, but I'm staying on the Rails.

<p>Topic 1: What are the benefits of version control?</p>

<p>
  As a beginner in the world of tech, maybe you're like me, and don't even know what version control is. Up until a week ago, I didn't know what this term meant, but once I read about it, I realized that I was familiar, very familiar with the concept. Have you ever been in a WordDoc, typing up an essay for school, or writing a journal entry, or maybe even a song or a letter to someone when suddenly you hit a random button on the keyboard and half of your work disappeared? Did you solve this problem by going to the Edit tab and clicking Undo? Then Undo again? Then Undo again? The premise of the undo button is the same premise that version control operates under—we as humans make mistakes, often, and need a way to go back and undo those mistakes (wouldn't it be great if we had computers ruling our whole lives and the undo button could be employed after getting in a car crash, or saying the wrong thing at the wrong time to someone you love, or after eating that cheap burrito from the only taqueria open past 2am?) However, unlike the Undo button, which can only be employed as far back as the last click of the save button, version control is a way for projects to be saved after changes have been made, and for the user to still be able to access all of the previous versions saved.
</p>
<p>
I remember going to a talk on my college campus once. Two authors were speaking to the audience about the writing process, and they were talking about how they usually have at least 50 versions of the book they are working on saved to their desktop, because they would save new versions of their books after adding and deleting chapters and paragraphs. Obviously these authors didn't know about version control and the awesome website GitHub that uses version control. If they knew about this resource, they would know that 50 versions were unnecessary to save as separate files, because all they would have to do is make a desired change to their work and then commit that change (GitHub's jargon for saving and explaining changes made). GitHub then tracks all commits made, allowing the creator to go back to a previous version of their work if so desired. So instead of having Book1, Book2, Book3, etc., etc. saved on a computer and taking up valuable space, GitHub saves all versions, under the same name, but allows the creator (author, blogger, coder, whatever) to go back and see all the changes they have committed in their work from the moment the work was created all the way up to the present moment. Like I mentioned before, wouldn't version control be great in real life? To just jump back to Brittney commit five years old and be back on that jungle gym with a few clicks of the keyboard...
</p>

<p>Back from my reverie...</p>

<p>Version control doesn't just help a single user. Say those authors I talked about were co-authoring a book, and needed a way to write what they each wanted to write, without permanently deleting what the other person wrote, and also without having to save 100 versions (50 per author) on their computers. Version control will track changes made by each author, then allow each author to integrate those changes made into a master version, but still keep all the previous copies, just in case something gets deleted (accidentally or purposefully) by the other person. So basically, version control and version control websites like GitHub help save your work and your working relationships.
</p>

<p>Topic 2:How does git help you keep track of changes?</p>
<p>
Now for a deeper delve into version control... One way version control works is through something called git (this is where GitHub gets its name). Git works from the command line in your terminal, and if you are a beginner in the tech world using your terminal may be terrifying, but it is absolutely necessary, so this blog is going assume that you have pulled out your inner Spartan spirit and have begun to use your command line by setting up all kinds of neat features, including git. Git works as one point in a triagulation of resources that work together to bring you version control—there is git, GitHub, and the text editor of your choice. It is in the text editor that you make actual changes to your work, then you access the changes on your command line via git, and then you 'push' those changes (after committing them) to GitHub where the changes are tracked and saved. Git is basically the middleman between your text editor and GitHub where version control lives and thrives. Git is the messenger, bringing GitHub all the new versions of your work from your text editor. Give git a hand. Git gets it all.
</p>


<p>Topic 3:Why use GitHub to store your code?</p>

<p>One final topic to round out this discussion about version control and git—why use GitHub? Well, as mentioned briefly, GitHub gets its name from git. It is the 'hub' of 'git'—the chatroom, the club, the bar where all the git messengers go to. It is the mullet of version control—business in the front, party in the back. GitHub not only tracks all of the changes you make to your work, but allows you to browse around and view other projects that are being worked on so that you can derive inspiration and motivation from others. It is the place to work and socialize. Like I mentioned in the fist topic, version control helps save working relationships, and GitHub helps create working relationships. You can't go wrong by giving GitHub a try.</p>

<p>Madness?? This is TECHNOLOGY!!</p>

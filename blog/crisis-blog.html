<h2> Crisis Prevention from a Crisis Survivor  <br />
  <span> October 13, 2014 </span></h2>

<div>
  <p> This past Friday, I was up late completing challenges and just having a general good time playing around on my computer. I didn't notice, but my mind was obviously tired because I proceeded to do something very, very stupid...
  <br /> Technically, it wasn't even Friday anymore, it was Saturday, and I began to do some housekeeping on my desktop. I came across the GitHub app icon, something I thought I had already deleted off my computer. To give you some background, before DBC phase 0 started, I was trying to get acquainted with GitHub, but it didn't make sense to me. I decided I would download the GitHub app for Mac, figuring it was more user friendly since I didn't consider myself a dev-in-training quite yet. It still didn't make sense, but that was because I didn't have any repos, or repos to fork from, or repos to clone. Anyway, once phase 0 started and I was configuring my computer with the various 12 programs and libraries and gems they have us set up, I encountered an issue with setting up git. I researched the issue I was having, and found many reports that having the GitHub for Mac app already installed messed with some configurations, so I deleted the app and continued on my way. Well, come the wee hours of Saturday morning, seeing the logo for the app sent me into a deleting frenzy. I was clearly on my way to being a dev, and didn't need some silly user interfacing app to do my GitHub projects from. I trashed the app, and waited for the 3000+ files to securely empty. All the while, I was working on a challenge. I finished, around the same time the trash finally emptied, and went to push my changes to GitHub. Suddenly, my terminal had no idea what I was trying to do. Error messages were popping up telling me I had the wrong path. I backtracked to git add, and another error telling me 'git command not found'. I didn't quite panic yet though, and hopped online to github.com....<br />
  Error! Can not access this website. Ensure that your proxy is not disabled or deleted. <br />
  My proxy what?! I didn't even know I had a proxy! I quickly tried accessing other websites.. no issues at all... I clearly was not supposed to delete that GitHub app. I started researching proxies and how to troubleshoot. I discovered that a proxy is basically an intermediary system that helps one computer communicate with either the web or other computers. That GitHub app had been installed when I configured my system in order to help my local files communicate with the remote GitHub system. But I had deleted it... Suddenly, the walls started closing in on me. I began to feel sick to my stomach, although, I still wasn't in complete panic (at least not yet). I jumped into my finder, and all my local files were still in tact. Yes, all I have to do is go back to the week 1 file and reconfigure my system. I began the steps... but I couldn't figure out the URL to clone from. I couldn't access any GitHub URL. Not only that, gitconfig was giving me errors- command not found. Now I was in crisis mode. I felt like I was floating in space, with nothing to hold onto. And our DBC angels weren't going to be back, reading emails until Monday...<br />
  I did the next best thing. I hoped on Google Chat and sent out an S.O.S. Another ship responded- Macs have Time Machine! I tried jumping into the life boat.... Time Machine was off! Instead of landing safely in the raft, I hit ice cold water, and was off floating again. I tried everything I could think of- but I couldn't even access help.github.com. Basically any webpage with github in it wasn't accessible. Two hours went by... I was about to let Jack go... And then I heard that voice again. What if you re-install the app? Now this was something I had thought of, but didn't try because no github.com site was accessible, so how was I supposed to get to the download link. I tried it anyway, what did I have to lose? I navigated to a non-github site that was showing up under the google search for GitHub for Macs. I went into the site. They had a link for downloading the zip file. I clicked it. The zip was downlaoding! It finished, I installed, and was prompted to enter my username and password... <br />
  I was in!!!! I navigated to github.com... it loaded!!!! I opened my terminal and typed git status.... master branch is 1 commit away from origin!!!! I was alive!! My GitHub was alive!! My files were alive and well, not even a ding or scratch! I couldn't believe what I was seeing!<br />
  So now, here I am, hoping that maybe someone will read this and know what to do if by some natural disaster, aka human stupidity, they delete their GitHub. Or maybe, that won't be the case, but some other coding crisis will be at hand, and they will read this and know they are not alone, floating in space or the Atlantic Ocean. And hopefully they will pull out the moral of the story and be able to apply it to their crisis- the simpliest solution is almost always the only solution, so try it first, and save yourself the stress and sickness. Oh and, make sure to sleep on urges to housekeep...

<h2> Tea Time  <br />
  <span> October 19, 2014 </span></h2>

<div>
<p> There is nothing quite like a good cup of tea- green, chai, herbal, floral, whatever your preference. With honey, with milk, maybe some lemon, or just by itself. If you're wondering where I am going with this, just hang in there, I promise tea is tech related. Well, the class Tea is related. Over the past week, we dove deeper into Ruby, and one of the big aspects of the curriculum was learning about Class. Now it might seem strange, but Class is actually an object. Its an object that bundles methods to call on other objects. Just think about it the way you normallay think of a class. A class is generally a group of people that all behave a certain way- a class of first graders, a senior class, or a socioeconomic class. The classes are made up of individuals (objects), that all generally act a certain way (methods), but the class itself, while made up of many parts, is a single unit (an object). I'm not going to continue with this visualization to explain more about Class, though, I'm going to use tea. Lets say that our class is Tea (the name of a class is called a 'constant', and it is always capitalized). Now under this class of tea, we have one basic method that will be applied to all of our tea objects. Since all tea has ingredients to be blended and boiled, that is going to be our 'instance method'. The instance method is the method that will be shared by all 'instances' of objects in the class. Now we want to get into specifics. Lets say our next method is going to be the method for making chai tea. We need an object for black tea, spices, and milk. To make the chai, though, all we need is the instance method- blend and boil. Our next method is going to be herbal tea. Our objects will be dried leaves, honey, and lemon. Once again, we only need to call our instance method though- blend and boil. Finally, we are going to include a method for making English style tea. Our objects are going to be black tea, milk, and honey. But wait a minute- we already used those same objects in the other two methods. This is another convenient and efficient aspect of classes- 'instance variables'! These variables are defined in such a way that you can use them in any method within the class, without having to redefine them everytime you reuse them. They are denoted with the @ sign. So now, in this last method we can use the instance variables and instance method to get the desired results. If this has left you slightly confused about what the syntax of all of this would look like, below is the code for our Tea class:</p>

<code>
class Tea <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;def procedure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blend and boil"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;end<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;def ingredients<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@black_tea = black tea leaves<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@spices = cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, cardamom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@milk = organic whole milk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@dried_leaves = dried edible plant leaves<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@honey = honey<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@lemon = fresh lemon juice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;end<br />


&nbsp;&nbsp;def chai<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chai_tea = @black_tea + @spices + @milk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chai_tea.procedure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;end<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;def herbal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;herbal_tea = @dried_leaves + @honey + @lemon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;herbal_tea.procedure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;end<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;def English_style<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;English_tea = @black_tea + @milk + @honey<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;English_tea.procedure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;end<br />
end<br />
</code>
<p>
In this example, techincally we wouldn't need spice or dried leaves to be instance variables, since those are each only used within one method. However, when writing a class, its good practice to use instance variables just in case you decide to expand the class, which is totally possible and always a great idea. Maybe one day we'll be feeling extra sick and want that kick of spices and herbs in our tea... Another technicality I should probably point out- this tea example wouldn't actually work as a Ruby code, its just a fun example about how classes work. You can't just add (+) variables, instance or otherwise, because variables are not implicitly integers. Also, "Blend and boil" is a string, and you can't just call a string on a variable and expect it to do something. But, I hope the example gives a good visualization about how classes and instance methods and variables work. Well, I gotta go for now, the tea pot is whistling at me!

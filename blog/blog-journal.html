<h2> "A Method to the Madness"   <br />
  <span> October 29, 2014 </span></h2>

<div>
  <p> This week at DBC, we switched gears and started learning the basics of JavaScript. We started off by reading <a href ="http://eloquentjavascript.net/Eloquent">Eloquent JavaScript</a>, and while I was, at first, intrigued by the title, I was soon not feeling the so called elegance of this Language. It seemed a bit too complex and yet also a bit too flexible, but this is probably because as a beginner I like easy-to-understand, concrete building blocks. I know though, that once I reach higher levels of dev experience, flexibility will be a great asset in programming, so I am trying not to judge JS too soon. I am already finding that simply moving from reading about JS theory to actual practice in completing this week's challenges, that JS is not as difficult as it seems when written out in paragraph form. So far it has actually been easier to pull out errors, easier to refactor, and easier to implement code based on test driven development techniques. Ruby and JS, both being object-oriented languages do share many basic elements, and so the leap from learning Ruby to learning JS is not too far. However, how these two languages treat similar elements is where most of the difference comes in. I would like to explore one of these differences that involves both languages' use of methods, and consequently, objects.</p>
  <p>In Ruby, there are basically two major umbrellas that all concepts fall under- objects and methods. Objects are like the nouns of English, and methods are like the verbs. A method in Ruby is any kind of action that is performed by an object or on an object. A method can be called directly on an object by using the dot <code>.</code> syntax, or by making a chunk of code that starts with <code>def</code> (for define method) and ends with <code>end</code>. Below is an  example of both versions being used one within an another:</p>

  <code>def empty?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;array.length == 0<br />
  end</code>

<p>In JavaScript, methods are also actions that can be called on objects. And in JS, objects are also some of the same things that they are in Ruby- strings, arrays, numbers. And, like in Ruby, many of the same methods for these objects are present, such as .push and .pop to add or remove elements in an array, or .length to find the length of a string. And yes, the dot notation is how you call a method on an object in JS. So, is there any difference besides the extra syntactical way in Ruby to define a method? The short answer is no, they are the same. The long answer is yes, they are different. Simply put, both languages have methods that are actions called on objects. But, the difference lies in what an object is in Ruby and what it is in JS. In Ruby, an object is anything that isn't a method, and actually just to complicate things, even methods are objects. Think of it in terms of the English language- a method is a set of actions, so its basically a set of verbs, but the fact that it is a set, makes it a noun. An object in JS is a piece of code that has values and properties. If it doesn't have these things, its just a variable. Now a variable can point to an object, such as a string, but they are different. The long definition of a method in JS is actually the properties of an object that contain functions. What are considered properties and functions in JS are simply methods in Ruby. Here is an example:</p>

<code>var array = []<br />
array.push("Hello");</code>

<p> What is going on in the JS method is that there is a variable (array), whose value is an array([]), and since an array has the properties associated with it such as being able to have elements added or deleted or joined, array is an object and the method is those properties in the form of an action, such as actually pushing a new element into an array, which is a function of the property of the array object. Try saying that five times fast.</p>
<p>So, I hope you see the method to the madness of methods, and not just the madness after reading this. Maybe now you can understand though why I prefer Ruby. JavaScript, while built upon the same principles as Ruby, is a more convoluted language if you ask me. But then again, ask anyone trying to learn English when it is not their native tongue, and they will tell you the same thing.</p>

<h2> Adventure Time!  <br />
  <span> October 29, 2014 </span></h2>

<div>
  <p> Last week I discussed something called Stereotype Threat, which is a theory about why people perform poorly if they are in a situation where they fear being reduced to a stereotype (to use Dionne Stanfield's excellent definition). One of the ways this threat can be reduced is by affirming to oneself what your values are. For this blog, we were given a list of approximately one hundred values, and were asked to pick just one that best describes what comes to mind when we think about our proudest and happiest moments. There were several that I felt applied to my greatest moments, but I narrowed it down to one that I felt is the umbrella for which the others fell under- ADVENTURE!</p>
  <p>Some of my proudest moments include moving away from home when I turned 18 to go work as a ski lift operator in Tahoe. I didn't know a single person, I had actually never even been to Tahoe, I didn't know where I was going to live, and I wasn't even sure I had a job yet, but I packed my little truck, secured a hotel room, and set off on the biggest adventure of my young life. It ended up being one of the most glorious years of my life- even though I ended up couch surfing for nine months. It was such a complete sense of freedom to not know what was going to be next, who I was going to meet, where I was going to be staying, what new trail I would be snowboarding. It was all so exhilarating! Another one of my happiest moments was finding out that I had gotten into UC Berkeley, after dreaming about going there for seven years! I had worked so hard to get into the one and only school I really saw myself going to, that I didn't even apply to any other schools. The feeling of getting in and seeing a whole new adventure opening up before me was once again the pinnacle of life for me. I was going to have to move from a sleepy beach town in Southern California to the urban mecca of the San Francisco Bay, where I once again didn't know anybody and didn't know where I was going to live. I packed up my little car and set off on another adventure, couch surfing again until I found a place. Then two years later, a new adventure started, a new venture into the unknown space of having a degree but no direction. The sense of being on an adventure compiles so many other aspects about life that I value the most- being independent, using intuition to guide me, having the freedom of the unknown, and being challenged to find deeper parts of my true being. I try to live everyday with these guiding principles, because every day really is a new adventure and an opportunity to find new places, both inside myself and in the world surrounding me.</p>
  <p>In my previous blog about Stereotype Threat, I mentioned that in order to keep myself from feeling the pressure of such a threat, I would remind myself that I was not in competition with anyone except myself. I think this couples well with my sense of life being an adventure. If I am always on an adventure and looking to challenge myself, even if I am in a situation where someone may be judging me based on a preconceived notion they have about who they think I am, that situation will be just another challenge, just another way to push myself to new limits and gain new insights. It will also be an opportunity to take msyelf out of the classification and see myself as independent from the group identity and realize that I am unique and far beyond just a generalized identity.</p>
  <p> This value that I place on independence is something that I know others around me admire because it is something that I get asked for advice about. I have friends and family members who, as much as they wish they could be, can not seem to break the confines of co-dependence. I wish I had answers for them, but this adventurous spirit that drives me is just something that is so innate it can't be ignored. When I feel trapped in places or situations I do not think to escape, I just do. I feel compelled into action by something that is so much bigger than me that I can not contain it. The only question I really ever ask is... SO WHO'S COMING WITH ME?!?</p>

<h2> Be Objective: Object-Oriented Design for Ruby  <br />
  <span> October 25, 2014 </span></h2>

<div>
  <p> Object-oriented design is a great approach to coding, not only because it works, but because it makes sense, at least for English speakers. In English, our language is objet-oriented as well. We say "The cat jumped over the fence." Or, "Dave likes cooking dinner." Or "Stephanie swims freestyle really fast." All of our sentences start with objects, and usually end with objects. The structure is one object performs an action that generally invloves other objects. Its not just that our language is structured this way, but rather it's that our thinking is structured this way, and our language follows that process, but then also reinforces it. We think in terms of objects, and those objects either do something, or have something done to them. Ruby, being the wonderfully human-friendly language that it is, is also object-oriented. On the other hand, there is something called functional programming. Functional programming, when examined, is Ruby's complete opposite. Two of the big keywords for FP are immutable and stateless, according to <a href= "http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/07/02/dont-be-scared-of-functional-programming/">Smashing Magazine </a>. Immutable means that the structures never change. But... things do change, that is the state of the world, even the state of our verbal and written languages. Words change meaning based on context constantly, and as time seems to move faster we invent ways to make our language follow along- LOL, BTW. Aside from that though, the physical state of things change constantly- lake levels lower as they are depleted of water, wrinkles appear, children grow taller by the day, spiders' teeth get longer with evolution (yes, this is a true fact about daddy long legs if you'd like to look it up). The point is, life is about change, so its strange to have a computer language that doesn't model this. I guess maybe its idealistic, in that sometimes we would feel better if things didn't change. The other keyword describing FP is stateless, that is, the structure has no knowledge of past or future executions of the program. Now this is really strange- we as humans only know what to do because of what has happened in the past, and only do what we do because of some future projection. Yes, stateless, living only in the moment, is a beautifully zen idea, but once again, it is not very realistic. I personally prefer to learn a language that is modeled off the human experience. *Fun fact: Twitter was first created using Ruby, an object- oriented language, but as it grew exponentially, was changed over to Scala, a functional language.* Now, lets dive in to some of of the specifics about object-oriented design in Ruby.</p>

  <p> One basic component is variable scope. You know how humans like to assign hierarchies? CEO's have all access to their companies, general managers have some access, and the basic employess have limited access? Varible scope works the same way. $global and CONSTANT variables have access across every instance of a program, meaning that every time the program is run, those variables don't change, and sometimes, depending on the output of the program, the variables compile. For example, if you make a program that adds a name into an array, if that array is a global or constant variable, every time the program is run, new names will be added into the same array. Then comes @@class and @instance variables. These variables are accessible within every class, so if you need every method in a class to know what a variable is, you use instance variables. Class variables do this as well, but go one step further and are accessible by all subsequent classes. This will become more clear when I explain inheritance, but basically one class can be the parent class to other classes, and so the subclasses will also have access to class variables. The final scope is local variables. These are variables that get assigned within a method, and are only known within that method.</p>

  <p> Speaking of methods and classes, Ruby has something called class methods. This is something I was a bit confused about, but makes sense if I don't try to complicate it. A class method is a main method that performs some task within a class, on that class. Say the method was called bark and the class was called Dog. We could then tell Dog to bark. Bark is part of Dog, it is part of the class itself, a method within it. But, the tricky part is that you can not tell all the other instances of Dog to bark. Why not? Because, as you can see below, bark is called only on self, and Dog is what self refers to. So, on the code below, you could call <code>Dog.bark</code>, but you can not call <code>Dog.new.bark</code>. But don't worry, all dogs will bark simply by running the class, since bark is part of the class.</p>
    <code>
    class Dog<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;def self.bark<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;puts "Bark, bark!"<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;end<br />
    end</code>
    </code>

  <p> Now, classes are a wonderful aspect of Ruby that group together methods. But, there is another aspect of Ruby that does the same thing- modules. The best way to distinguish the two is to think about objects vs methods. A module is a built in set of methods that can be performed. For example, there is the Enumerable module that I blogged about in "Ruby Groupies" that has built in methods that all build on the built in .each method. That's easy enough to understand, right? Well, I'm going to complicate it a little more. You know how you build your own classes, and so probably think that that is the class that I'm comparing module to? Well, those classes are actually part of a class called Class. Its really nothing more than a organizational system, so try to keep thinking simple. Some other classes include Array, Hash, String, Integer, the list goes on. A class is just a group of objects that have built in functions. You know how if you are trying to add (+) two strings, you will get an error, "No explict conversion of String to Fixnum"? That's because + is a method that belongs to the Integer, Fixnum, and Bignum classes. Classes are groups of the same objects, such as integers, that have methods. The difference between a module then, is that a module is the group of methods that can be performed on an object. The basis of a class is the object, while the basis of the module is the method. Bring to mind the example of the Enumerable module, which I explained has the foundation of the .each method, exemplifying that a module has its foundation on a method, while a class, such as String, has its foundation on that object. If you're wondering now, "So, not everything in Ruby is object-oriented?"... just remember that methods are performed on objects and by objects, so even modules can be traced back to being object-oriented, but lets not worry about that.</p>
  <p> Now that I've confused you about classes, lets go back to our initial idea about what a class is- a constructed grouping in our code. And as promised, I am going to explain the whole parent-subclass inheritance thing. Remember my blog "Tea Time"? Remember how there was the class Tea, that I said could be broken down into subclasses of Chai, Herbal, and English_style? That's because all of these subclasses share the properties of Tea, but then bring in their own unique components. We could then create subclasses, and have them each 'inherit' the method from Tea that they all share, while being able to function separately from each other. Now, since good programming keeps pieces of code from being to too dependant on other pieces of code for reasons of changability, inheritance, while a cool concept because it shows hierarchy, isn't always a good practice to get into. A better alternative most of the time is to use 'composition.' Now, this is something I have yet to come across in DBC challenges, but I am going to try to explain it. Composition is like inheritance, but the class that uses the methods supplied by composition is not tied to it, only a single object is, so the class itself is less dependant. It will probably help to see some code:</p>
    <code>class Tea<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;attr_accessor :blend, :boil<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;def procedure<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@blend = blend_of_ingredients<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@boil = pot_of_hot_water<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;end<br />
    end<br />
    <br />
    class Chai < Tea<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;def make_tea<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@blend = ["black tea", "spices", "milk"]<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@boil<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;end<br />
    end</code>
  <p>Based on the above program, if something gets changed in Tea, all of Chai will be changed as well. Since it is the subclass, the whole class is dependant on it, hence the < sign. Now while this isn't the end of the world in our tiny little tea program, for a big program this could be a huge pain. Composition on the other hand supplies code only for a single object within a class, not the object of objects that a class is. To be completely honest, since I have yet to use composition, and resources found on the internet are difficult to understand, I am going to leave off on supplying code for this. The point to take away though is a subclass inherits all the properites of its entire parent class, while composition gives properties only to a single object.</p>
  <p> Before leaving this topic though, I would like to explain a few things about the above code. Remember how I said @@class variables can be used by subclasses, but not @instance variables? Does this make you wonder why I was able to use instance variables? Were you also wondering what the attr_accessor line was all about? Attr_accessor, meaning attribute accessor, sets up variables that will be accessible by subclasses, even without @@class variables. There are also attr_writer and attr_reader, meaning that a subclass can either just read a variable, or it can actually write over it. Attr_accessor gives permission to do both. Pretty neat huh? Just don't go typing that program into irb or a ruby file. Like my last Tea class code, it's just a fun visualization about how inheritance works, it wouldn't actually do anything.</p>
  <p> Finall, I would like to explain some points about another hierarchy found in Ruby- blocs, procs, and lambdas. Blocs are short lines of code that execute some kind of action. Below is one of the most common blocs:</p>
    <code>def array_print<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;array.each {|element| print element}<br />
    end</code>
  <p> The part of the code in {curly braces} is the bloc. We could also write it as follows, since the opening curly brace means 'do this' and the closing one means 'stop doing that':</p>
    <code>def array_print<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;array.each do |element|<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print element<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;end<br />
    end</code>
  <p> Now say we had a bloc of code, that was actually some command that was much longer than just a simple print statement, and not only was it long, but we needed to reuse it over and over in out program? Well, in order to follow the DRY (don't repeat yourself) rule, we could save the bloc, or rather the action needed into a 'proc', which is short for procedure. The above code would then be changed to the following:</p>
    <code>def array_print<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;print = Proc.new do |element|<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print element<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;end<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;array1(print)<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;array2(print)<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;array3(print)<br />
    end</code>
  <p> I hope you can see the hierarchy, because now I am going to add a step higher. First there is blocs, then procs, then lambdas. Lambdas are basically procs, but with all the capabilities of a full on method. They check for number of arguments and they do not stop at the first value returned, but continue on until the whole method is executed. Here is a final bit of code to explain what I mean:</p>
    <code>def array_print<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;array(lambda {|element| print element})<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;print "Here's another element"<br />
    end</code>
  <p> If the above code was a proc, only the first element would be printed. But a lambda will print the first element, and "Here's another element".</p>
  <p> And that is where I will leave you for now. I'm sure your brain has a lot to process about object-oriented design and Ruby.</p>

<h2> Stereo[type] Threat  <br />
  <span> October 21, 2014 </span></h2>

<div>
  <p> Stereotype threat is a term coined by Dr. Claude Steele that explains the underperformance of certain groups of people in situations where they feel the pressure of their identity playing a role in the outcome of the situation. He uses an example of an experiment conducted that show women who generally excel at math being given a math test in which they are  told that the test is known to show the difference between men and women's abilities in math. He also uses various examples about the effects of race identity in given situations. The conclusion is that it is those who are the most invested in the outcome who perform the worst under stereotype threat because they are essentially trying so hard not to confirm the stereotype, that they put detrimental amounts of stress upon themsleves and perform badly. </p>
  <p> In my personal experience, out of the many common social identities that one could hold, the only one that I feel I actually apply to myself is being female. As a kid growing up, I was a tomboy and loved playing sports in the street with my dad, brother, and neighborhood boys. Nobody ever seemed to mind the fact that I was a girl, and I was good, especially at football. But then by the time I entered middle school, the fact that I was a girl did start to become an issue for the boys. They would gang up on me and not let me play, never telling me exactly that I couldn't play, but the ball would never get passed to me, or the puck, as I fell in love with street hockey. This usually only happened when certain boys were around, but even when they weren't, and I was playing and having a good time with the boys who didn't mind that I was a girl, I was suddenly becoming worse. I couldn't score, I missed the puck a lot, I tripped more often, and generally stopped having a good time, which eventually led me to stop playing altogether. I never consciously believed that any lack of skill was because I was a girl, but I did feel the pressure to be even better than the boys so I could prove I belonged in the game. When I saw myself not proving this, I slowly lost interest in even trying to join the game. Now I know that this feeling has an actual theoretical name- Stereotype Threat. I was feeling that I was proving I didn't belong, so I stopped trying, and made the excuse that I had lost interest in the game, but really the stress of trying to go beyond a stereotype caused me to quit so that the threat of reinforcing the stereotype would go away. </p>
  <p> Acedemically, which is what Dr. Steele focuses on, I can't say I've ever felt Stereotype Threat. I excelled at math in high school naturally, and never felt the pressure to excel just because I was female. In college, Psychology and English Lit were my focus, two subjects that are stereotypically subjects that women tend to excel in anyway, so I definitely didn't feel the pressure to disprove a negative stereotype there. Now that I am entering into the tech field though, I am entering into a negatively stereotyped area for women. However, I can't say that I feel the pressure, yet. This may be because right now there is a bg focus on getting more women into the industry, so I feel the stereotypes are being broken down already around me and I don't have anything to prove, I'm just happy to be a part of the progress. Or maybe its because so far at DBC we are only in phase 0, so I am not around the predominantly male cohort comparing my skills to theirs. Or maybe its because I talk to some of the guys at DBC who are just as worried about not being on par with the program, so I am seeing that perceived success really has nothing to do with being female or male. Whatever it is, I think mainataining exactly what I just expressed is the key to overcoming Stereotype Threat- knowing and believing the fact that everyone is in the same boat and somewhere in the learning curve, regardless of being male or female. I think something else that will help if I ever do start to feel the pressure, is reminding myself that this is not a competition- its not a competition between myself and other individuals, or between my gender/sex and another gender/sex. I am here to do my personal best, and if any pressure occurs, it should be me trying to prove to myself that I can excel at something I hadn't thought I could excel at. Its me against me, not me against negative stereotypes.</p>

<h2> Tea Time  <br />
  <span> October 19, 2014 </span></h2>

<div>
  <p> There is nothing quite like a good cup of tea- green, chai, herbal, floral, whatever your preference. With honey, with milk, maybe some lemon, or just by itself. If you're wondering where I am going with this, just hang in there, I promise tea is tech related. Well, the class Tea is related. </p>
  <p>Over the past week, we dove deeper into Ruby, and one of the big aspects of the curriculum was learning about Class. Now it might seem strange, but Class is actually an object. Its an object that bundles methods to call on other objects. Just think about it the way you normallay think of a class. A class is generally a group of people that all behave a certain way- a class of first graders, a senior class, or a socioeconomic class. The classes are made up of individuals (objects), that all generally act a certain way (methods), but the class itself, while made up of many parts, is a single unit (an object). I'm not going to continue with this visualization to explain more about Class, though, I'm going to use tea.</p>
  <p>Lets say that our class is Tea (the name of a class is called a 'constant', and it is always capitalized). Now under this class of tea, we have one basic method that will be applied to all of our tea objects. Since all tea has ingredients to be blended and boiled, that is going to be our 'instance method'. The instance method is the method that will be shared by all 'instances' of the class. Now we want to get into specifics. Lets say our next method is going to be the method for making chai tea. We need an object for black tea, spices, and milk. To make the chai, though, all we need is the instance method- blend and boil. Our next method is going to be herbal tea. Our objects will be dried leaves, honey, and lemon. Once again, we only need to call our instance method though- blend and boil. Finally, we are going to include a method for making English style tea. Our objects are going to be black tea, milk, and honey. But wait a minute- we already used those same objects in the other two methods. This is another convenient and efficient aspect of classes- 'instance variables'! These variables are defined in such a way that you can use them in any method within the class, without having to redefine them everytime you reuse them. They are denoted with the @ sign. So now, in this last method we can use the instance variables and instance method to get the desired results. If this has left you slightly confused about what the syntax of all of this would look like, below is the code for our Tea class:</p>

    <code>class Tea <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;def procedure<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blend and boil"<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;end<br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;def ingredients<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@black_tea = black tea leaves<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@spices = cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, cardamom<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@milk = organic whole milk<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@dried_leaves = dried edible plant leaves<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@honey = honey<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@lemon = fresh lemon juice<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;end<br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;def chai<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chai_tea = @black_tea + @spices + @milk<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chai_tea.procedure<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;end<br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;def herbal<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;herbal_tea = @dried_leaves + @honey + @lemon<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;herbal_tea.procedure<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;end<br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;def english_style<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;english_tea = @black_tea + @milk + @honey<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;english_tea.procedure<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;end<br />
    end</code>

  <p> We also can't forget to call our program. I feel like having chai today....</p>

    <code>tea_time = Tea.new<br />
    tea_time.chai</code>

  <p> Actually, I changed my mind, I would like English style </p>
    <code>tea_time = Tea.new<br />
    tea_time.english_style</code>


  <p>In this example, techincally we wouldn't need spice or dried leaves to be instance variables, since those are each only used within one method. However, when writing a class, its good practice to use instance variables just in case you decide to expand the class, which is totally possible and always a great idea. Maybe one day we'll be feeling extra sick and want that kick of spices and herbs in our tea. Speaking of expansion, it is actually possible, and would be better to expand this class into 4 classes. Tea would be a parent class, and we could make chai, herbal, and English style their own classes, which would be subclasses of Tea. This gets more complicated though, so I will just leave this post at the basics. Let's call this post the parent post, and the more specified, subclass post will be coming soon. Another technicality I should probably point out- this tea example wouldn't actually work as a Ruby code, its just a fun example about how classes work. You can't just add (+) variables, instance or otherwise, because variables are not implicitly integers. Also, "Blend and boil" is a string, and you can't just call a string on a variable and expect it to do something. But, I hope the example gives a good visualization about how classes and instance methods and variables work. Well, I gotta go for now, the tea pot is whistling at me!</p>

<h2> Feedback: Its what's for Breakfast  <br />
  <span> October 18, 2014 </span></h2>

<div>
  <p> Well this week's topic is a little surprising. Here at DBC we have to reflect on everything that we do, and we have to give others feedback about how they do in our pairing sessions, we have to give feedback on other people's feedback, and now we have to blog about feedback... I'm thinking feedback is only mildly important to DBC... : D<br/>
  All sarcasm aside, I actually really enjoy this aspect of the program. In a setting where I don't interact face to face with instructors (at least not yet in phase 0), and most of my interactions with other students are via unreliant Comcast and TimeWarner internet connections (kind of crazy to think that these two companies run the whole internet and cable connections of the US, but that is a tangent), aside from my own personal accomplishments through completing challenges, I have no idea how I'm actually progressing. Am I on par with other students? Do they feel held back while in pairing sessions with me? Am I living up to the standards of DBC's culture of empathy and tenacity? Are others going to enjoy being around me when we are actually together 9-15 hours a day for 9 weeks straight?? Without opportunites to pair program and then receive feedback about those sessions, I would have no idea how I was doing. And better yet, most of the feedback comes from other students. When I was attending Cal, the only feedback I got was from professors in the form of A-F grades- not exactly helpful. And usually by the time we got our grades back, the next paper was due a week later, and that is not enough time if I realized after getting my paper back that I was needing to improve in certain areas of essay writing. And then exams- one final at the end of the semester, testing me if I knew the whole semester of work. Not exactly a system that leaves room for much improvement. Here at DBC though, I get the opportunity to improve my critical thinking skills, social skills, emotional stability skills, empathy skills, critical response skills, and much more on a daily to weekly basis.</p>
  <p> I have to keep these positives in mind every time I go into another pairing session, because no matter how many I do, they are still nerve wracking. I've come to know a few people, and know that our learning styles mesh well for pairing, but when pairing with a new person I always wonder if I'm going to hold them back, are they going to carry the team? Will I be able to give any useful solutions? I've come to realize that pairing is a huge challenge in itself for me, aside from the actual challenge we're faced with solving. I like to stay in my head, and follow problems through the labyrinth of my thoughts. I like to experiment as I go, and I like to set problems aside, read and research for awhile when I get stuck, then come back to the actual coding. I enjoy silence while coding, I don't even listen to music (although I am right now because this is blogging, not coding, and what can I say, Phutureprimitive Radio after midnight on a Saturday just gets my intuitive writer side going). But when I'm pairing, not only am I having to listen and stay focused on what someone else is saying, I'm having to talk, and try to focus on what to say. I know I seem wordy in my blog posts, but honestly talking about problems and how I'm thinking about solving them is one of the most foreign feelings to me. I'm extremely introverted when it comes to problem solving and study habits. I never did group study sessions, or even studied in the library, or at cafes the way the other students in college did. I had to be in my room, door closed, no distractions. Now with pair programming my mind is being forced to focus in so many ways at once- focus on the other person's thought process while trying to map mine, while trying to focus on what they are saying, while trying to respond, while looking at code and reading side material, while sometimes being watched by a guide... it makes my head spin just thinking about it.</p>
  <p> One thing I have enjoyed about pairing though is pairing in person. It is so much easier when we aren't trying to screen share and deal with internet cuts and audio going out or video freezing. Because of this, I know I am going to enjoy pair programming at DBC's immersive program much more, and actually can't wait to be coding out of my tiny apartment which I've been hermited in for the past 5 weeks. <br />
  Another positive thing is that I know from the feedback I've received that I don't actually come off as awkward as I feel while pairing. All the feedback I've received has been right on par with what I expected to hear. The sessions where I was confident in my knowledge and skills, were scored higher in the benefitted technically category, and then other times when my pair was clearly more knowledgeable I scored around the neutral range. I am happy to see that I've consistently scored high in the culture and respect aspects of the feedback. As far as what people have told me specifically in feedback, its mostly in regards to my known weaknessess- mostly to become more familiar with the methods and syntax, and to not be nervous. I've recieved lots of feedback in regards to having great communication skills, so that's awesome to hear when I feel like communicating my thoughts is such a challenge. Overall, everyone has been really KIND, ACTIONABLE, and SPECIFIC, and I really appreciate the time they've put into pairing with me, helping me understand concepts better, and then giving me feedback. I think the feedback aspect of the program is what makes it special- we become a community of students, helping each other progress and not letting each other fall behind- its about accountability and community and that's really amazing.</p>
  <p> In addition to receiving feedback, I've had to write feedback for others, and usually this is a bit of a struggle. I always know what to say in regards to the positive aspects, but usually I get stuck on how to give actionable feedback, especially when my pair clearly carried the team. How do I tell someone else they need to improve, when I feel I am the one who needs the most improvement? That I have to say is the biggest struggle I have with giving feedback. Being SPECIFIC, no problem. Being KIND, that's easy. Being ACTIONABLE... well I have an actionable note to self- improve at writing actionable fedback.</p>

<h2> Crisis Prevention from a Crisis Survivor  <br />
  <span> October 13, 2014 </span></h2>

<div>
  <p> This past Friday, I was up late completing challenges and just having a general good time playing around on my computer. I didn't notice, but my mind was obviously tired because I proceeded to do something very, very stupid...
  <br /> Technically, it wasn't even Friday anymore, it was Saturday, and I began to do some housekeeping on my desktop. I came across the GitHub app icon, something I thought I had already deleted off my computer. To give you some background, before DBC phase 0 started, I was trying to get acquainted with GitHub, but it didn't make sense to me. I decided I would download the GitHub app for Mac, figuring it was more user friendly since I didn't consider myself a dev-in-training quite yet. It still didn't make sense, but that was because I didn't have any repos, or repos to fork from, or repos to clone. Anyway, once phase 0 started and I was configuring my computer with the various 12 programs and libraries and gems they have us set up, I encountered an issue with setting up git. I researched the issue I was having, and found many reports that having the GitHub for Mac app already installed messed with some configurations, so I deleted the app and continued on my way. Well, come the wee hours of Saturday morning, seeing the logo for the app sent me into a deleting frenzy. I was clearly on my way to being a dev, and didn't need some silly user interfacing app to do my GitHub projects from. I trashed the app, and waited for the 3000+ files to securely empty. All the while, I was working on a challenge. I finished, around the same time the trash finally emptied, and went to push my changes to GitHub. Suddenly, my terminal had no idea what I was trying to do. Error messages were popping up telling me I had the wrong path. I backtracked to git add, and another error telling me 'git command not found'. I didn't quite panic yet though, and hopped online to github.com....<br />
  Error! Can not access this website. Ensure that your proxy is not disabled or deleted. <br />
  My proxy what?! I didn't even know I had a proxy! I quickly tried accessing other websites.. no issues at all... I clearly was not supposed to delete that GitHub app. I started researching proxies and how to troubleshoot. I discovered that a proxy is basically an intermediary system that helps one computer communicate with either the web or other computers. That GitHub app had been installed when I configured my system in order to help my local files communicate with the remote GitHub system. But I had deleted it... Suddenly, the walls started closing in on me. I began to feel sick to my stomach, although, I still wasn't in complete panic (at least not yet). I jumped into my finder, and all my local files were still in tact. Yes, all I have to do is go back to the week 1 file and reconfigure my system. I began the steps... but I couldn't figure out the URL to clone from. I couldn't access any GitHub URL. Not only that, gitconfig was giving me errors- command not found. Now I was in crisis mode. I felt like I was floating in space, with nothing to hold onto. And our DBC angels weren't going to be back, reading emails until Monday...<br />
  I did the next best thing. I hoped on Google Chat and sent out an S.O.S. Another ship responded- Macs have Time Machine! I tried jumping into the life boat.... Time Machine was off! Instead of landing safely in the raft, I hit ice cold water, and was off floating again. I tried everything I could think of- but I couldn't even access help.github.com. Basically any webpage with github in it wasn't accessible. Two hours went by... I was about to let Jack go... And then I heard that voice again. What if you re-install the app? Now this was something I had thought of, but didn't try because no github.com site was accessible, so how was I supposed to get to the download link. I tried it anyway, what did I have to lose? I navigated to a non-github site that was showing up under the google search for GitHub for Macs. I went into the site. They had a link for downloading the zip file. I clicked it. The zip was downlaoding! It finished, I installed, and was prompted to enter my username and password... <br />
  I was in!!!! I navigated to github.com... it loaded!!!! I opened my terminal and typed git status.... master branch is 1 commit away from origin!!!! I was alive!! My GitHub was alive!! My files were alive and well, not even a ding or scratch! I couldn't believe what I was seeing!<br />
  So now, here I am, hoping that maybe someone will read this and know what to do if by some natural disaster, aka human stupidity, they delete their GitHub. Or maybe, that won't be the case, but some other coding crisis will be at hand, and they will read this and know they are not alone, floating in space or the Atlantic Ocean. And hopefully they will pull out the moral of the story and be able to apply it to their crisis- the simpliest solution is almost always the only solution, so try it first, and save yourself the stress and sickness. Oh and, make sure to sleep on urges to housekeep...</p>

<h2> "Hack and Attack" <br />
  <span> October 12, 2014 </span></h2>

<div>
  <p> With all the new technology out there, its hard to keep up. But I don't mean it in the usual sense that its hard to keep up with the best upgrades or all the newest toys. Its hard to keep up with knowing how your life could be hacked at any moment. Technology is supposed to make our lives easier, right? Well, yes, but technology doesn't discriminate between the good guys and the bad guys- so what makes the honest person's life easier, also makes the criminal's life easier. Here are just a few examples happening since the start of October: </p>
  <p>
  <a href= "http://www.today.com/news/new-technology-could-give-thieves-key-your-door-literally-2D80161986">1. Online site makes keys from photos, and ships to any address, no photo ID required. </a> <br />
  <a href= "http://www.businessinsider.com/snapchat-hacked-the-snappening-2014-10">2. Personal information is hacked all the time, leading to identity theft. But what if not just who you were on paper was leaked, but what you looked like, with clothes and without?</a> <br />
  <a href= "http://www.komando.com/happening-now/275413/gigantic-hack-hits-76-million-jpmorgan-chase-bank-accounts-3-things-to-know-now/all">3. If huge multi-billion dollar companies like J.P. Morgan, Target, and Home Depot can be hacked, can't anybody?</a>
  </p>
  <p> The issue is this- there is just no privacy anymore. Cloud technology wants every bit of your personal local files, uploaded to the internet, all in the name of backup and ease of mind. Free source software wants your ideas out in the open, in the name of collaboration and visibility. There is even a new health app that appeared with the new iOS 8 software that logs every meal, medication, and medical condition if you so desire. Don't get me started on GoogleGlass watching your every move. Technology is helping make our lives easier- but is it taking away our lives? If we rely on an app to tell us if we're eating healthy, will we start to ignore our actual bodies even more? If we backup all our files onto the internet, in fear that our personal computer may crash, are we ignoring the fact that all those files could be getting hacked? I mean, even the FBI has been hacked. </p>
  <p>Don't get me wrong, I love technology. I love my iPhone and my MacBook, and my iPad, and my Nook, and my iPod. I love my coffee maker, and my car, and my camera. But, I love my privacy more. Its why I'm not on Facebook, or Snapchat, and up until DBC I wasn't on Twitter and I wasn't blogging. In a world that seeks immortality, fame, and being remembered by the masses, I'm actually ok with being lost to the sands of time. I like uncomplicated. I like knowing that I can say the wrong thing and only one person will know- the person that I'm having an in-person conversation with. I like to know that my pictures and journal entries can only be seen by me, because afterall, they are snapshots of the life I want to remember, not have remembered by strangers. But all of this leaves me in a kind of limbo- I love technology that helps make life easier, but I also don't like relying on technology too much. So, the question is, for someone like me entering into the tech world, how do I balance these two values?</p>
  <p> For me, the answer lies in what we use technology for. How about instead of spending millions on Angry Birds, Candy Crush, and other mind-distracting games that only take us further away from the sensorial moments of life, we spend that money and innovation on improving online security? Or better yet, how about we use that time to go to the damn keysmith ourselves instead of even having a need for keys to be made online and shipped to our doors, and giving thieves access to those same doors.</p>
  <p> I'm not the only one who contemplates these issues. Security is a huge factor in technology development. No bank, or store, or company wants to be hacked. The FBI definitely doesn't want to be hacked. Individuals don't want to be hacked.Is there a better way to protect ourselves from fraud than passwords and pins? I think so. The thing is this- computers are hackable because they are created with finite sets of code that can be decoded, languages that can essentially be learned by anyone. But what if we as individual users, were able to make our own codes to store files and personal information? You know how everyone has a unique voice, but not only that, unique ways of telling stories and unique ways of using the same set rules of language to create very individual ways of speaking and writing? What if there was a way to get that uniquness translated into the computer world? What if, instead of using a simple username and password, we were instructed to write out a sentence, or speak into a microphone, or something along those lines that accounted for us being unique human beings, not just numbers and symbols strung together? I am already just a phone number, credit card number, social security number, various account numbers, a house number in a zip code, and an IP address. You would think that all these numbers in their seeming anonymity would help protect our privacy, but what if it is actually the opposite case? What if it is what makes us us, that can help protect our privacy? I don't have the answers for how to create this technology, but its something that I would be excited to see in the future.</p>

<h2> "Ruby Groupies" <br />
  <span> October 11, 2014 </span></h2>

<div>
  <p>
  Over the past couple of weeks, going through the Phase 0 challenges, I have started using methods that fall under the Enumerable module. This module wasn't something I had encountered in my prep material, but the methods included under that title were. I remember learning about methods such as <code>sort</code>, <code>count</code>, <code>min</code>, <code>max</code>, <code>include?</code>, and <code>to_a</code>. Suddenly though, as I was reading the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/">Ruby docs</a>, looking for methods to implement for my challenges, these methods were being classified as Enumerable methods. Now before I was chasing the dream of being a dev, I was an English major. I have a background in language, basically words and their meanings. Since the word 'enumerable' has the root 'numeral', my mind came to its own conclusion that these methods were methods that could be called on the 'numbers' in the objects that I was calling them on, since everytime I was using these methods I was dealing with arrays and hashes, both of which are objects that contain any 'number' of objects. This may seem weird- I mean, I could have just looked up Enumerable and figured out what it actually meant- but I was satisfied with my own semantic deduction. Then came this blog prompt, so I decided I better figure out what Enumerable actually was before attempting to teach others about it. I started by reading chapter 10 in <a href ="http://www.manning.com/black3/">"The Well Grounded Rubyist, 2nd ed."</a> And guess what... my semantic deduction was not wrong! Good 'ol English. The Enumerable module has the <code>each</code> method as its foundation. Built upon this <code>each</code> method foundation are many other methods that are built into the Enumerable module, such as the ones I listed above and many more. (If the term module is throwing you off, like it did for me at first, its a pretty simple concept- its basically a group of characteristics that many objects share in common.) All of these methods, since <code>each</code> is their foundation, act upon 'each' object within any other object, such as arrays and hashes, and also classes. I came up with a fun way to remember this fact:<br />
  Enumerable = E + numer + able = Each + number + is able <br />
  Meaning, that 'each' object within the 'number' of objects, is going to be 'able' to do something. For instance, the <code>max</code> method, is going to go through each string, integer, or float in an array, and be able to find the one that has the highest value.<p>

  <p> Now that I have explained a little bit about the Enumerable class, and I hope it all makes sense to you, I would like to go more in depth about one Enumerable method in particular- <code>group_by</code>. Does the title of my blog make sense now? I'm sure you were wondering... Luckily, <code>group_by</code> is one of those great methods that does just what it sounds like it would (here we are, back to semantics)- it 'groups' objects 'by' a criteria. Chapter 10.3.4 gives a clear and fun example of this method in action by using colors. I don't want to just give you their example though, so here is one of my own, using something just as awesome as colors- music! </p>

    <code>def first_letter(bands)<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;bands.group_by {|l| l[0]}<br />
    end<br />
    <br />
    output = first_letter(["Goo Goo Dolls", "Alice in Chains", "Nirvana", "Red Hot Chili Peppers", "Soundgarden", "Blink-182", "Matchbox 20", "Radiohead", "No Doubt", "Sublime"])<br />
    puts output</code>

    <p> Can you guess what the output will be? I'll give you a hint: <code>group_by</code> returns a hash of arrays... This is the output of the above Ruby code:</p>

    <code>{"G"=>["Goo Goo Dolls"], "A"=>["Alice in Chains"], "N"=>["Nirvana", "No Doubt"], "R"=>["Red Hot Chili Peppers", "Radiohead"], "S"=>["Soundgarden", "Sublime"], "B"=>["Blink-182"], "M"=>["Matchbox 20"]}</code>

  <p> Pretty neat huh? And you can group by many criteria, including <code>size</code> or <code>length</code> and more complex criteria, like adding the method <code>include?</code> to group together objects that include certain letters or numbers, or even strings.
  </p>
  <p>Now that you know more about the Enumerable module, and one of its methods, get to grouping you Ruby groupie you!</p>

<h2> "My Gregorc Thinking Style: Concrete Random" <br />
  <span> October 5, 2014 </span></h2>

<div>
  <p>I took a test about how I think and learn. It's probably one of the more informative tests I've ever taken. Most tests tell me what I've learned, or didn't learn, never how I learn. And I have to say, reading through the descriptions, the test definitely wasn't wrong- it all sounds like me, except one point, which I will discuss. So what did I score? How do I think and learn? I scored the title Concrete Random Thinker.</p>

  <p>Here is what is said about the Concrete Pereceptual Quality aspect of my thinking style:</p>

  <p>This quality enables you to register information directly through your five senses: sight, smell, touch, taste, and hearing. When you are using your concrete ability, you are dealing with the obvious, the "here and now." You are not looking for hidden meanings, or making relationships between ideas or concepts.</p>

  <p>This is where I find one indiscretion- I love to find relationships between ideas and concepts! I am a right-brain dominant thinker (this was another test I took), meaning I look at the big picture, not neccessarily little details in a linear fashion. Everything is connected, everything builds upon one another, and it helps me tremendously to find points of connection between information in order to see the big picture and understand the individual parts better. However, I do agree that I am a learner through my senses. I must experience something to really know it and understand it.</p>

  <p>For the Abstract Ordering Ability aspect of my thinking style, this is what is said about it (and I must say, its me to a T!):</p>

  <p>Lets your mind organize information by chunks, and in no particular order. When you are using your random ability, you may often be able to skip steps in a procedure and still produce the desired result. You may even start in the middle, or at the end, and work backwards. You may also prefer your life to be more impulsive, or spur of the moment, than planned.</p>

  <p>This is why I was so terrible at math proofs! I was always skipping steps, and didn't even know I was, my brain was just jumping ahead. I'm also terrible at teaching other people skills, like math, and even snowboarding- I don't know how I know, I just know. And I am very impulsive- I like to move around a lot, never with a plan, just a nagging sense of I must go somewhere new. For some people the lack of structure that I live by would be frightening, but for me it keeps life exciting, and hey, its that exact impulsion that got me to DBC-one minute I was web-surfing, the next I was applying, and a couple weeks later I was in and dropping serious cash on a compeletely new endeavour that I had never dreamed of pursuing.</p>

  <p>As a Concrete Random Thinker, these are the more specific learning styles that work best for me:</p>

  <p>This learner likes:<br />
  -experimenting to find answers<br />
  -taking risks<br />
  -using their intuition<br />
  -solving problems independently</p>

  <p>They learn best when:<br />
  -they are able to use trial-and-error approaches<br />
  -able to compete with others<br />
  -given the opportunity to work through the problems by themselves.</p>

  <p>What's hard for them?<br />
  -Restrictions and limitations<br />
  -Formal reports<br />
  -Routines<br />
  -Re-doing anything once it's done<br />
  -Keeping detailed records<br />
  -Showing how they got an answer<br />
  -Choosing only one answer<br />
  -Having no options</p>

  <p>Yes, yes, yes, to all of that! Routines, ugh, no options, my soul is being crushed! Using intuition, taking risks- this is what I live by! So how can I use all of this to my advantage at DBC? Well, like I said, its all of this that even got me to DBC in the first place, so that's pretty awesome. If I look at everything on this list though, I'd have to say that the greatest asset to me so far at DBC has been my experiemental mind. When I look for solutions to code, I try everything I can think of, until finally something is right. I actually don't restrict myself to time-constraints (although I know time-boxing will be good for some projects), because when I'm in the flow, I don't want that to be halted by a routine break. My thinking style is also a pretty independent style, so being able to just code for hours by myself has been great. I really enjoy just being alone, with my computer, sunshine or moonshine streaming through the open windows. I thought Pair Programming was going to be difficult because of this independent attitude, but I find it to be a good challenge. I will have to get better at working in a team for when I get a job, so I better learn to overcome some of these innate thinking habits now, such as not being good at showing how I got to an answer. Now that I know how I think, I need to focus on tracking my thoughts, so I can better understand where my mind is going and then getting it to go where I want it to.</p>

  <p>Overall, I have a deep thirst for knowledge and a sincere enjoyment of learning. I definitely consider myself to have a growth mindset. Learning is all about effort. If I don't try to learn new things, I will never know them. For instance, I had really never painted in my life, until a few years ago. I did actually have a fixed mindset when it came to the arts. I did think that some people were just born with innate abilities towards painting and music. One day though, I decided that the reason I couldn't paint was because I had never tried. Some people may have an innate calling towards something, but anyone can learn how to do anything. Once I started painting, I then turned to the violin. Lo and behold, not only can I paint, but I can play music too! And now... I can code! The possible skills I can develop are endless, and it all starts with trying new things. One thing I do need to work on though, is being more open to learning from others. Like I said before, my thinking style is rather independent, but if I broaden my horizons and seek more interactions with others, the skills I can be exposed to and pick up myself greatly increases.</p>

<h2> "Array vs. Hash" <br />
  <span> October 4, 2014 </span></h2>

<div>
  <p>When I first encountered these two classes in Ruby, the first one, array, made sense. It is an array (an ordered arrangement)of objects, that can vary from integers and floats to strings, all of which can be saved within the same array. The second class, hash, even though it is similar to an array in concept had me asking, "Why is it called a hash?" The title just didn't seem to reveal what it was, until I looked up hash in the dictionary. Hash is not just a food, or slang for something you smoke, the definition of hash is: a mixture of jumbled incongruous things; a mess. While nothing in well-written Ruby code is actually a mess, this helped me see one of the big differences between arrays and hashes. An array, following its definition, is an ordered arrangement, for ex.</p>

    <code>favorite_things = ["elephants", "chocolate", 5, "green", 1987] </code>

  <p>Even though an array can contain different kinds of objects, they all fall under the name of the array, and are related and ordered by this.</p>

  <p>A hash on the other hand contains much more information, because instead of being basically just a list within brackets, like an array, hashes contain keys and values, giving it more layers of information.  Lets see what the above example would look like in hash form:</p>

    <code>favorite_things { <br />
      animal: "elephant", <br />
      food: "chocolate", <br />
      number: 5, <br />
      color: "green",<br />
      year: 1987<br />
    }</code>

  <p>As you can see, its not really a mess, it makes perfect sense how these things go together, but if we were to look at just  the keys(in this case <code>animal</code>, <code>food</code>, <code>number</code>, <code>color</code>, <code>green</code>) they do seem like incongruous things. They only become related by  their values being related as favorite things.</p>

  <p>In my personal opinion hashes are the superior way to store information, simply because it is much easier to access the stored info. If I were to want to access my favorite color in the array, the only way to find it would be to point to its position in the array, using an integer. The first item in the array is given the value <code>0</code>, the second is <code>1</code>, and so forth. So, I would need to know that color was the fourth item and access it by typing:</p>

    <code>favorite_things[3]</code>

  <p>With hashes though, you can access the information by using the key, which to me is much easier to remember. So, I could find my favorite color by typing:</p>

    <code>favorite_things[color]</code>

  <p>As far as methods go, almost all the same methods can be used for both arrays and hashes, some of the most common being <code>.each</code>, <code>.include?</code>, and <code>.length</code>, making hashes and arrays equally useful. However, like I said before, hashes seem logically superior based on the fact that you can access the value by the key, instead of a place-holder integer.</p>

<h2> "CSS: Short for Color, Style, and Spacing... Just Kidding!" <br />
  <span> September 25, 2014 </span></h2>

<div>
  <p>When first starting off using CSS, you may wonder about the difference between the margin, border, and padding properties of your HTML content. They basically seem like window frames within window frames. I like to think of them in more humorous terms- padding is the underwear, it goes closest to the content, then comes the boarder, which is the pants and jacket, and finally, the margin is the personal space bubble. Whether you want to utilize all these layers is up to your personal preference, and the occasion. If you choose not to specify their sizes and colors, these layers will be set to a default, and still exist, but you just may not notice them. For example, unless you change the colors, you may not notice they are there at all, but they are really just blending in with the background.</p>

  <p>Here is a simplified picture of the layers, and in a moment I will explain more in depth about their various functions.</p>

    <img src="http://xhtml.com/8FCEE4B2-AF88-4574-BBC6-3C94FBD64380/border-box-model.gif"class="centeredImage" alt="CSS Framing" height="300px" width="400px"/>

  <p>As you can see, the padding is the space between the content and the border. Since everyting in CSS is essentially a box, whether the content is a single letter, a sentence, a paragraph, an image, a div, or a table, everything essentially has a border, even if you can't see it. (By the way, the black line that outlines this picture, is its border set to <code>2px solid black</code>). By specifying the padding size, which you can set to all four sides differently or equally, you push or bring in the border closer or further away from your content- boxers or briefs if you will.</p>

  <p>Now the margin on the other hand is the space outside the border, and it doesn't really affect the content as much as it affects your contents' relationship to other content on the page. If your margin is set to a higher number, other content will stay far away, but if it is set to 0 (this is usually the default), other content will be rubbing right up in the other contents' personal space.</p>

  <p>There are several ways you can go about setting up the various sizes of the padding, border, and margins around the content of your page.You can use the following: </p>
  <p>
    <code>px</code>: for pixels, basically one single dot on your screen.<br />
    <code>pt</code>: for point, like a pixel, it is only 1/72 of an inch.<br />
    <code>%</code>: which will make the padding, border, or margin a percentage of the content size<br />
    or, simply<br />
    <code>cm</code>: for centimeter, or<br />
    <code>in</code>: for inches.
  </p>

  <p>You can also choose how specific you want to be in your code.<br />
  Look at the following examples:</p>

    <code>
      square {<br />
            margin: 10px;<br />
      }<br />
    <br / >
      rectangle {<br />
            margin: 10px, 5px, 10px, 5px;<br />
      }
    </code>

  <p>The <code>10px</code> you see for square is denoting that all sides will be the same size. <br />
  The numbering for the rectangle is showing that you want the top margin to be <code>10px</code>, the right margin to be <code>5px</code>, the bottom margin to be <code>10px</code>, and the left margin to be <code>5px</code>. Like a clock it starts on top, and works its way around.</p>

  <p>And that my friends is the basics of padding, borders, and margins in CSS. The rest is up to you to play around with and get the feel for what numbers look like what around the content of your page.</p>

  <p>And remember... its CSS... its ok to be a...</p>

  <p>One of the biggest things that sets DevBootcamp apart from other coding bootcamps is its emphasis on human interaction and understanding. DevBootcamp doesn't prepare its students to sit in little cubicles for 8 hours a day, shut off from sunlight and conversation. DevBootcamp prepares students to become team members, problem solvers, on-their-toes-thinkers, and from-the-heart engagers. And I can't wait to be in a classroom full of the teachers and students who have been selected to undertake this personal and collective challenge!</p>
  <p>Until the beginning of this summer, I had never imagined in my wildest dreams that I would enter into the world of technology. Seriously... in the past year I had just discovered what the tab button does while on websites that ask for information input... and that my iPhone had a flashlight built in (I downloaded an app for that). I'm not ashamed to admit these things because I'm not ashamed of who I am. I have worked really hard developing other skills and acquiring other knowledge over the past 27 years of my life. But then something shifted in me. I would say that a courage surfaced that I had never experienced before. I say that I worked really hard at other skills, and I did, but in all honesty the skills I developed were skills that came naturally to me. Technology is all brand new territory for me, and to take this leap of faith has taken tremendous courage. If I learn nothing about actual coding, I am still so proud of myself to have mustered up this courage that I didn't even know I had. This is why I chose DevBootcamp, and why I am honored that they have chosen me. DevBootcamp sees something in me that I didn't even see, and they see something in every student that has been chosen. This is incredible! We don't get that in traditional education systems. Traditional education systems don't even meet you. DevBootcamp has a personal video chat before they chose who they will accept. Traditional education systems base acceptance on how good you look on paper. DevBootcamp uses intuition and the sense of personal connection to accept applicants, and I am so excited to be a part of the community they have knitted together.</p>
  <p>I am a people-person. I have been a server in the restaurant industry for about 10 years and I was going to be a teacher. The thought of having to sit at a desk isolated in corporate America was soul crushing to me. I have friends who are developers in San Francisco, but even after knowing them and knowing what they do, my mind wasn't pursuaded to even think about learning coding. Then one day I typed into my google search "coding bootcamp" and the very first link to come up was DevBootcamp, so I followed the link. Right away I was introduced to the colorful DBC culture of engineering empathy and mindfulness. I checked out the page of teachers and saw all these friendly, smiling faces staring back at me, and I was hooked! Now after going through the pre-prep work and one week of phase 0 I am even more hooked. I have seen several videos made by the creators of DBC and they are so personable and humble—they are people-people, and that puts someone like me, who knows nothing about the world of computers at ease because I know they aren't going to judge me based on my knowledge, but my willingness to engage and talk and explore, and that is something I know I can do. I am also more at ease knowing that the world of technology isn't just filled with code pushing people stuck at desks all day—its a community of social creatures that want to improve themselves and help others improve too, whether those other people are their co-workers or the people who they build better apps and software for.</p>
  <p>Like I said before, if I learn nothing about actual coding, I will not consider any of this journey nil and void (pun intended), because the transformation that has already taken place, and that will only continue to grow, has been life changing. I am eternally grateful to be given this opportunity at DevBootcamp and for the creators of this marvelous experiment.</p>

<h2> "A Beginner's Guide for Beginners in Git and GitHub" <br />
  <span> September 19, 2014 </span></h2>

<div>
  <p>Topic 1: What are the benefits of version control?</p>

  <p>As a beginner in the world of tech, maybe you're like me, and don't even know what version control is. Up until a week ago, I didn't know what this term meant, but once I read about it, I realized that I was familiar, very familiar with the concept. Have you ever been in a WordDoc, typing up an essay for school, or writing a journal entry, or maybe even a song or a letter to someone when suddenly you hit a random button on the keyboard and half of your work disappeared? Did you solve this problem by going to the Edit tab and clicking Undo? Then Undo again? Then Undo again? The premise of the undo button is the same premise that version control operates under—we as humans make mistakes, often, and need a way to go back and undo those mistakes (wouldn't it be great if we had computers ruling our whole lives and the undo button could be employed after getting in a car crash, or saying the wrong thing at the wrong time to someone you love, or after eating that cheap burrito from the only taqueria open past 2am?) However, unlike the Undo button, which can only be employed as far back as the last click of the save button, version control is a way for projects to be saved after changes have been made, and for the user to still be able to access all of the previous versions saved.</p>
  <p>I remember going to a talk on my college campus once. Two authors were speaking to the audience about the writing process, and they were talking about how they usually have at least 50 versions of the book they are working on saved to their desktop, because they would save new versions of their books after adding and deleting chapters and paragraphs. Obviously these authors didn't know about version control and the awesome website GitHub that uses version control. If they knew about this resource, they would know that 50 versions were unnecessary to save as separate files, because all they would have to do is make a desired change to their work and then commit that change (GitHub's jargon for saving and explaining changes made). GitHub then tracks all commits made, allowing the creator to go back to a previous version of their work if so desired. So instead of having Book1, Book2, Book3, etc., etc. saved on a computer and taking up valuable space, GitHub saves all versions, under the same name, but allows the creator (author, blogger, coder, whatever) to go back and see all the changes they have committed in their work from the moment the work was created all the way up to the present moment. Like I mentioned before, wouldn't version control be great in real life? To just jump back to Brittney commit five years old and be back on that jungle gym with a few clicks of the keyboard...</p>

  <p>Back from my reverie...</p>

  <p>Version control doesn't just help a single user. Say those authors I talked about were co-authoring a book, and needed a way to write what they each wanted to write, without permanently deleting what the other person wrote, and also without having to save 100 versions (50 per author) on their computers. Version control will track changes made by each author, then allow each author to integrate those changes made into a master version, but still keep all the previous copies, just in case something gets deleted (accidentally or purposefully) by the other person. So basically, version control and version control websites like GitHub help save your work and your working relationships.</p>

  <p>Topic 2:How does git help you keep track of changes?</p>
  <p>Now for a deeper delve into version control... One way version control works is through something called git (this is where GitHub gets its name). Git works from the command line in your terminal, and if you are a beginner in the tech world using your terminal may be terrifying, but it is absolutely necessary, so this blog is going assume that you have pulled out your inner Spartan spirit and have begun to use your command line by setting up all kinds of neat features, including git. Git works as one point in a triagulation of resources that work together to bring you version control—there is git, GitHub, and the text editor of your choice. It is in the text editor that you make actual changes to your work, then you access the changes on your command line via git, and then you 'push' those changes (after committing them) to GitHub where the changes are tracked and saved. Git is basically the middleman between your text editor and GitHub where version control lives and thrives. Git is the messenger, bringing GitHub all the new versions of your work from your text editor. Give git a hand. Git gets it all.</p>


  <p>Topic 3:Why use GitHub to store your code?</p>

  <p>One final topic to round out this discussion about version control and git—why use GitHub? Well, as mentioned briefly, GitHub gets its name from git. It is the 'hub' of 'git'—the chatroom, the club, the bar where all the git messengers go to. It is the mullet of version control—business in the front, party in the back. GitHub not only tracks all of the changes you make to your work, but allows you to browse around and view other projects that are being worked on so that you can derive inspiration and motivation from others. It is the place to work and socialize. Like I mentioned in the fist topic, version control helps save working relationships, and GitHub helps create working relationships. You can't go wrong by giving GitHub a try.</p>

  <p>Madness?? This is TECHNOLOGY!!</p>

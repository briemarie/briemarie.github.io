<h2> "Array vs. Hash" <br />
  <span> October 4, 2014 </span></h2>

<div>
<p>
When I first encountered these two classes in Ruby, the first one, array, made sense. It is an array (an ordered arrangement)of objects, that can vary from integers and floats to strings, all of which can be saved within the same array. The second class, hash, even though it is similar to an array in concept had me asking, "Why is it called a hash?" The title just didn't seem to reveal what it was, until I looked up hash in the dictionary. Hash is not just a food, or slang for something you smoke, the definition of hash is: a mixture of jumbled incongruous things; a mess. While nothing in well-written Ruby code is actually a mess, this helped me see one of the big differences between arrays and hashes. An array, following its definition, is an ordered arrangement, for ex.
</p>

<code>favorite_things = ["elephants", "chocolate", 5, "green", 1987] </code>

<p>Even though an array can contain different kinds of objects, they all fall under the name of the array, and are related and ordered by this.</p>

<p>A hash on the other hand contains much more information, because instead of being basically just a list within brackets, like an array, hashes contain keys and values, giving it more layers of information.  Lets see what the above example would look like in hash form:</p>

<code>favorite_things { <br />
  animal: "elephant", <br />
  food: "chocolate", <br />
  number: 5, <br />
  color: "green",<br />
  year: 1987<br />
}</code>

<p>As you can see, its not really a mess, it makes perfect sense how these things go together, but if we were to look at just  the keys(in this case animal, food, number, color, green) they do seem like incongruous things. They only become related by  their values being related as favorite things.</p>

<p>In my personal opinion hashes are the superior way to store information, simply because it is much easier to access the stored info. If I were to want to access my favorite color in the array, the only way to find it would be to point to its position in the array, using an integer. The first item in the array is given the value 0, the second is 1, and so forth. So, I would need to know that color was the fourth item and access it by typing:</p>

<code>favorite_things[3]</code>

<p>With hashes though, you can access the information by using the key, which to me is much easier to remember. So, I could find my favorite color by typing:</p>

<code>favorite_things[color]</code>

<p>As far as methods go, almost all the same methods can be used for both arrays and hashes, some of the most common being .each, .include?, and .length, making hashes and arrays equally useful. However, like I said before, hashes seem logically superior based on the fact that you can access the value by the key, instead of a place-holder integer.

<h2> "CSS: Short for Color, Style, and Spacing... Just Kidding!" <br />
  <span> September 25, 2014 </span></h2>

<div>
  <p>
    When first starting off using CSS, you may wonder about the difference between the margin, border, and padding properties of your HTML content. They basically seem like window frames within window frames. I like to think of them in more humorous terms- padding is the underwear, it goes closest to the content, then comes the boarder, which is the pants and jacket, and finally, the margin is the personal space bubble. Whether you want to utilize all these layers is up to your personal preference, and the occasion. If you choose not to specify their sizes and colors, these layers will be set to a default, and still exist, but you just may not notice them. For example, unless you change the colors, you may not notice they are there at all, but they are really just blending in with the background.
  </p>

    <p>
      Here is a simplified picture of the layers, and in a moment I will explain more in depth about their various functions.
    </p>

<img src="http://xhtml.com/8FCEE4B2-AF88-4574-BBC6-3C94FBD64380/border-box-model.gif"class="centeredImage" alt="CSS Framing" height="300px" width="400px">

<p>
  As you can see, the padding is the space between the content and the border. Since everyting in CSS is essentially a box, whether the content is a single letter, a sentence, a paragraph, an image, a div, or a table, everything essentially has a border, even if you can't see it. (By the way, the black line that outlines this picture, is its border set to 2px solid black). By specifying the padding size, which you can set to all four sides differently or equally, you push or bring in the border closer or further away from your content- boxers or briefs if you will.
</p>

<p>
  Now the margin on the other hand is the space outside the border, and it doesn't really affect the content as much as it affects your contents' relationship to other content on the page. If your margin is set to a higher number, other content will stay far away, but if it is set to 0 (this is usually the default), other content will be rubbing right up in the other contents' personal space.
</p>

<p>
  There are several ways you can go about setting up the various sizes of the padding, border, and margins around the content of your page.You can use the following: </p>
  <p>
  px: for pixels, basically one single dot on your screen.<br />
  pt: for point, like a pixel, it is only 1/72 of an inch.<br />
  %: which will make the padding, border, or margin a percentage of the content size<br />
  or, simply<br />
  cm: for centimeter, or<br />
  in: for inches.
</p>

<p>
  You can also choose how specific you want to be in your code.<br />

  Look at the following examples:</p>
<p>
  square {<br />
        margin: 10px<br />
  }<br />

  rectangle {<br />
        margin: 10px, 5px, 10px, 5px<br />
  }</p>

  <p>
  The 10px you see for square is denoting that all sides will be the same size. <br />
  The numbering for the rectangle is showing that you want the top margin to be 10px, the right margin to be 5px, the bottom margin to be 10px, and the left margin to be 5px. Like a clock it starts on top, and works its way around.
</p>

<p>
And that my friends is the basics of padding, borders, and margins in CSS. The rest is up to you to play around with and get the feel for what numbers look like what around the content of your page.</p>

<p>And remember... its CSS... its ok to be a...</p>

    One of the biggest things that sets DevBootcamp apart from other coding bootcamps is its emphasis on human interaction and understanding. DevBootcamp doesn't prepare its students to sit in little cubicles for 8 hours a day, shut off from sunlight and conversation. DevBootcamp prepares students to become team members, problem solvers, on-their-toes-thinkers, and from-the-heart engagers. And I can't wait to be in a classroom full of the teachers and students who have been selected to undertake this personal and collective challenge!
  </p>
  <p>
  Until the beginning of this summer, I had never imagined in my wildest dreams that I would enter into the world of technology. Seriously... in the past year I had just discovered what the tab button does while on websites that ask for information input... and that my iPhone had a flashlight built in (I downloaded an app for that). I'm not ashamed to admit these things because I'm not ashamed of who I am. I have worked really hard developing other skills and acquiring other knowledge over the past 27 years of my life. But then something shifted in me. I would say that a courage surfaced that I had never experienced before. I say that I worked really hard at other skills, and I did, but in all honesty the skills I developed were skills that came naturally to me. Technology is all brand new territory for me, and to take this leap of faith has taken tremendous courage. If I learn nothing about actual coding, I am still so proud of myself to have mustered up this courage that I didn't even know I had. This is why I chose DevBootcamp, and why I am honored that they have chosen me. DevBootcamp sees something in me that I didn't even see, and they see something in every student that has been chosen. This is incredible! We don't get that in traditional education systems. Traditional education systems don't even meet you. DevBootcamp has a personal video chat before they chose who they will accept. Traditional education systems base acceptance on how good you look on paper. DevBootcamp uses intuition and the sense of personal connection to accept applicants, and I am so excited to be a part of the community they have knitted together.

I am a people-person. I have been a server in the restaurant industry for about 10 years and I was going to be a teacher. The thought of having to sit at a desk isolated in corporate America was soul crushing to me. I have friends who are developers in San Francisco, but even after knowing them and knowing what they do, my mind wasn't pursuaded to even think about learning coding. Then one day I typed into my google search "coding bootcamp" and the very first link to come up was DevBootcamp, so I followed the link. Right away I was introduced to the colorful DBC culture of engineering empathy and mindfulness. I checked out the page of teachers and saw all these friendly, smiling faces staring back at me, and I was hooked! Now after going through the pre-prep work and one week of phase 0 I am even more hooked. I have seen several videos made by the creators of DBC and they are so personable and humble—they are people-people, and that puts someone like me, who knows nothing about the world of computers at ease because I know they aren't going to judge me based on my knowledge, but my willingness to engage and talk and explore, and that is something I know I can do. I am also more at ease knowing that the world of technology isn't just filled with code pushing people stuck at desks all day—its a community of social creatures that want to improve themselves and help others improve too, whether those other people are their co-workers or the people who they build better apps and software for.
</p>
<p>
Like I said before, if I learn nothing about actual coding, I will not consider any of this journey nil and void (pun intended), because the transformation that has already taken place, and that will only continue to grow, has been life changing. I am eternally grateful to be given this opportunity at DevBootcamp and for the creators of this marvelous experiment.

<h2> "A Beginner's Guide for Beginners in Git and GitHub" <br />
  <span> September 19, 2014 </span></h2>

<div>
<p>Topic 1: What are the benefits of version control?</p>

<p>
  As a beginner in the world of tech, maybe you're like me, and don't even know what version control is. Up until a week ago, I didn't know what this term meant, but once I read about it, I realized that I was familiar, very familiar with the concept. Have you ever been in a WordDoc, typing up an essay for school, or writing a journal entry, or maybe even a song or a letter to someone when suddenly you hit a random button on the keyboard and half of your work disappeared? Did you solve this problem by going to the Edit tab and clicking Undo? Then Undo again? Then Undo again? The premise of the undo button is the same premise that version control operates under—we as humans make mistakes, often, and need a way to go back and undo those mistakes (wouldn't it be great if we had computers ruling our whole lives and the undo button could be employed after getting in a car crash, or saying the wrong thing at the wrong time to someone you love, or after eating that cheap burrito from the only taqueria open past 2am?) However, unlike the Undo button, which can only be employed as far back as the last click of the save button, version control is a way for projects to be saved after changes have been made, and for the user to still be able to access all of the previous versions saved.
</p>
<p>
I remember going to a talk on my college campus once. Two authors were speaking to the audience about the writing process, and they were talking about how they usually have at least 50 versions of the book they are working on saved to their desktop, because they would save new versions of their books after adding and deleting chapters and paragraphs. Obviously these authors didn't know about version control and the awesome website GitHub that uses version control. If they knew about this resource, they would know that 50 versions were unnecessary to save as separate files, because all they would have to do is make a desired change to their work and then commit that change (GitHub's jargon for saving and explaining changes made). GitHub then tracks all commits made, allowing the creator to go back to a previous version of their work if so desired. So instead of having Book1, Book2, Book3, etc., etc. saved on a computer and taking up valuable space, GitHub saves all versions, under the same name, but allows the creator (author, blogger, coder, whatever) to go back and see all the changes they have committed in their work from the moment the work was created all the way up to the present moment. Like I mentioned before, wouldn't version control be great in real life? To just jump back to Brittney commit five years old and be back on that jungle gym with a few clicks of the keyboard...
</p>

<p>Back from my reverie...</p>

<p>Version control doesn't just help a single user. Say those authors I talked about were co-authoring a book, and needed a way to write what they each wanted to write, without permanently deleting what the other person wrote, and also without having to save 100 versions (50 per author) on their computers. Version control will track changes made by each author, then allow each author to integrate those changes made into a master version, but still keep all the previous copies, just in case something gets deleted (accidentally or purposefully) by the other person. So basically, version control and version control websites like GitHub help save your work and your working relationships.
</p>

<p>Topic 2:How does git help you keep track of changes?</p>
<p>
Now for a deeper delve into version control... One way version control works is through something called git (this is where GitHub gets its name). Git works from the command line in your terminal, and if you are a beginner in the tech world using your terminal may be terrifying, but it is absolutely necessary, so this blog is going assume that you have pulled out your inner Spartan spirit and have begun to use your command line by setting up all kinds of neat features, including git. Git works as one point in a triagulation of resources that work together to bring you version control—there is git, GitHub, and the text editor of your choice. It is in the text editor that you make actual changes to your work, then you access the changes on your command line via git, and then you 'push' those changes (after committing them) to GitHub where the changes are tracked and saved. Git is basically the middleman between your text editor and GitHub where version control lives and thrives. Git is the messenger, bringing GitHub all the new versions of your work from your text editor. Give git a hand. Git gets it all.
</p>


<p>Topic 3:Why use GitHub to store your code?</p>

<p>One final topic to round out this discussion about version control and git—why use GitHub? Well, as mentioned briefly, GitHub gets its name from git. It is the 'hub' of 'git'—the chatroom, the club, the bar where all the git messengers go to. It is the mullet of version control—business in the front, party in the back. GitHub not only tracks all of the changes you make to your work, but allows you to browse around and view other projects that are being worked on so that you can derive inspiration and motivation from others. It is the place to work and socialize. Like I mentioned in the fist topic, version control helps save working relationships, and GitHub helps create working relationships. You can't go wrong by giving GitHub a try.</p>

<p>Madness?? This is TECHNOLOGY!!</p>

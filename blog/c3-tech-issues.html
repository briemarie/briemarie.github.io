<h2> "Hack and Attack" <br />
  <span> October 12, 2014 </span></h2>

<div>
<p> With all the new technology out there, its hard to keep up. But I don't mean it in the usual sense that its hard to keep up with the best upgrades or all the newest toys. Its hard to keep up with knowing how your life could be hacked at any moment. Technology is supposed to make our lives easier, right? Well, yes, but technology doesn't discriminate between the good guys and the bad guys- so what makes the honest person's life easier, also makes the criminal's life easier. Here are just a few examples happening since the start of October: </p>
<p>
<a href= "http://www.today.com/news/new-technology-could-give-thieves-key-your-door-literally-2D80161986">1. Online site makes keys from photos, and ships to any address, no photo ID required. </a> <br />
<a href= "http://www.businessinsider.com/snapchat-hacked-the-snappening-2014-10">2. Personal information is hacked all the time, leading to identity theft. But what if not just who you were on paper was leaked, but what you looked like, with clothes and without?</a> <br />
<a href= "http://www.komando.com/happening-now/275413/gigantic-hack-hits-76-million-jpmorgan-chase-bank-accounts-3-things-to-know-now/all">3. If huge multi-billion dollar companies like J.P. Morgan, Target, and Home Depot can be hacked, can't anybody?</a>
</p>
<p> The issue is this- there is just no privacy anymore. Cloud technology wants every bit of your personal local files, uploaded to the internet, all in the name of backup and ease of mind. Free source software wants your ideas out in the open, in the name of collaboration and visibility. There is even a new health app that appeared with the new iOS 8 software that logs every meal, medication, and medical condition if you so desire. Don't get me started on GoogleGlass watching your every move. Technology is helping make our lives easier- but is it taking away our lives? If we rely on an app to tell us if we're eating healthy, will we start to ignore our actual bodies even more? If we backup all our files onto the internet, in fear that our personal computer may crash, are we ignoring the fact that all those files could be getting hacked? I mean, even the FBI has been hacked. </p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I love technology. I love my iPhone and my MacBook, and my iPad, and my Nook, and my iPod. I love my coffee maker, and my car, and my camera. But, I love my privacy more. Its why I'm not on Facebook, or Snapchat, and up until DBC I wasn't on Twitter and I wasn't blogging. In a world that seeks immortality, fame, and being remembered by the masses, I'm actually ok with being lost to the sands of time. I like uncomplicated. I like knowing that I can say the wrong thing and only one person will know- the person that I'm having an in-person conversation with. I like to know that my pictures and journal entries can only be seen by me, because afterall, they are snapshots of the life I want to remember, not have remembered by strangers. But all of this leaves me in a kind of limbo- I love technology that helps make life easier, but I also don't like relying on technology too much. So, the question is, for someone like me entering into the tech world, how do I balance these two values?</p>
<p> For me, the answer lies in what we use technology for. How about instead of spending millions on Angry Birds, Candy Crush, and other mind-distracting games that only take us further away from the sensorial moments of life, we spend that money and innovation on improving online security? Or better yet, how about we use that time to go to the damn keysmith ourselves instead of even having a need for keys to be made online and shipped to our doors, and giving thieves access to those same doors.</p>
<p> I'm not the only one who contemplates these issues. Security is a huge factor in technology development. No bank, or store, or company wants to be hacked. The FBI definitely doesn't want to be hacked. Individuals don't want to be hacked.Is there a better way to protect ourselves from fraud than passwords and pins? I think so. The thing is this- computers are hackable because they are created with finite sets of code that can be decoded, languages that can essentially be learned by anyone. But what if we as individual users, were able to make our own codes to store files and personal information? You know how everyone has a unique voice, but not only that, unique ways of telling stories and unique ways of using the same set rules of language to create very individual ways of speaking and writing? What if there was a way to get that uniquness translated into the computer world? What if, instead of using a simple username and password, we were instructed to write out a sentence, or speak into a microphone, or something along those lines that accounted for us being unique human beings, not just numbers and symbols strung together? I am already just a phone number, credit card number, social security number, various account numbers, a house number in a zip code, and an IP address. You would think that all these numbers in their seeming anonymity would help protect our privacy, but what if it is actually the opposite case? What if it is what makes us us, that can help protect our privacy? I don't have the answers for how to create this technology, but its something that I would be excited to see in the future.</p>

<h2> Can I Ask You a Question?  <br />
  <span> November 12, 2014 </span></h2>

<div>
<p> Have you ever asked a question, that wasn't really a question, it was more of a statement? Have you ever asked a question that was really more gibberish spilling out of you in panic? Have you ever asked someone, "Hey, can I ask you a question?" Only to hear back the annoyingly accurate response, "You just did." Asking questions seems like a simple endeavor so long as the question is still only floating around in your own mind. Articulating a question is much more complex. Articulating a good question is an art. </p>
<p> I for one, usually fall under the gibberish spilling out of me in panic questions, at least as far as my embarkment at DBC is concerned. I have sent numerous emails and chat questions that were written hastily as I tried not to freak out completely over something I did wrong. I can imagine that many users on StackOverflow must feel this same panic, and yet almost all the questions asked on the site are poignant, clear, and easy to answer (not because the question is easy to answer, but because it is clear what the asker is seeking). Would I get the responses I needed if I were to post my questions, or would I leave my readers even more confused than I am?</p>
<p> One thing that is great about StackOverflow is that they actually give guidelines for writing good questions that are more likely to generate good answers. The starting point for a good question is the title. I can't even tell you how many times I have asked Google a question, only to have the exact question be the title of a StackOverflow post. (I guess this means I am at least sometimes good at asking questions). The title should be a specific, sinlge sentence summary of the question. Even if you need to ask a question of someone in-person, I think this is a good guideline. Think to yourself before asking aloud what the question would be in a single sentence. If you can do that, you have a good baseline to build the rest of the question from.</p>
<p> The next step is to flush out the actual issue before an example is given. If your question can not be identified without showing the example, the question will probably not be clear to whoever is trying to answer, plus, the answer will not help you learn for future issues- you will have only received an answer for a specific problem. Questions should help grow your understanding of a concept, not solve a problem for you. A good question and a good answer will help expand your thought process. However, showing an example is a great idea to illustrate the problem to the person you are aksing the question of. An example should accompany the question though, the question shouldn't accompany the example. Also, don't forget to include context. Especially here in the tech world, many issues are specific to languages, frameworks, file types, browsers, and operating systems. In order to recieve an implementable answer, these specifics need to be outlined or else the answer may not solve the user specific problem. Outside the tech world, this is solid advice as well. Questions, like life, do not exist in a vaccuum and involve many factors that make up the context of the problem. It does not serve the questioner or the answerer to have vital information left out.</p>
<p> One final point that I would like to make about asking good questions, is probably the most important of all- know what kind of answer you are looking for, becasue if you don't, how will you know when you get it? Have you ever had someone ask you for advice, only to have them completely disregard everything you advised? This is usually because when we ask for advice, we don't just want any advice, we want a specific answer, so we will ask several people until we hear what we want to hear. While this probably isn't the best idea in all cases, it serves as a good example. When asking a question, knowing at least generally what you are needing to hear to solve the issue will help you be more satisfied with the right answers, or to keep searching and not settling on the first response.<p>

<h2> Adventure Time!  <br />
  <span> October 29, 2014 </span></h2>

<div>
  <p> Last week I discussed something called Stereotype Threat, which is a theory about why people perform poorly if they are in a situation where they fear being reduced to a stereotype (to use Dionne Stanfield's excellent definition). One of the ways this threat can be reduced is by affirming to oneself what your values are. For this blog, we were given a list of approximately one hundred values, and were asked to pick just one that best describes what comes to mind when we think about our proudest and happiest moments. There were several that I felt applied to my greatest moments, but I narrowed it down to one that I felt is the umbrella for which the others fell under- ADVENTURE!</p>
  <p>Some of my proudest moments include moving away from home when I turned 18 to go work as a ski lift operator in Tahoe. I didn't know a single person, I had actually never even been to Tahoe, I didn't know where I was going to live, and I wasn't even sure I had a job yet, but I packed my little truck, secured a hotel room, and set off on the biggest adventure of my young life. It ended up being one of the most glorious years of my life- even though I ended up couch surfing for nine months. It was such a complete sense of freedom to not know what was going to be next, who I was going to meet, where I was going to be staying, what new trail I would be snowboarding. It was all so exhilarating! Another one of my happiest moments was finding out that I had gotten into UC Berkeley, after dreaming about going there for seven years! I had worked so hard to get into the one and only school I really saw myself going to, that I didn't even apply to any other schools. The feeling of getting in and seeing a whole new adventure opening up before me was once again the pinnacle of life for me. I was going to have to move from a sleepy beach town in Southern California to the urban mecca of the San Francisco Bay, where I once again didn't know anybody and didn't know where I was going to live. I packed up my little car and set off on another adventure, couch surfing again until I found a place. Then two years later, a new adventure started, a new venture into the unknown space of having a degree but no direction. The sense of being on an adventure compiles so many other aspects about life that I value the most- being independent, using intuition to guide me, having the freedom of the unknown, and being challenged to find deeper parts of my true being. I try to live everyday with these guiding principles, because every day really is a new adventure and an opportunity to find new places, both inside myself and in the world surrounding me.</p>
  <p>In my previous blog about Stereotype Threat, I mentioned that in order to keep myself from feeling the pressure of such a threat, I would remind myself that I was not in competition with anyone except myself. I think this couples well with my sense of life being an adventure. If I am always on an adventure and looking to challenge myself, even if I am in a situation where someone may be judging me based on a preconceived notion they have about who they think I am, that situation will be just another challenge, just another way to push myself to new limits and gain new insights. It will also be an opportunity to take msyelf out of the classification and see myself as independent from the group identity and realize that I am unique and far beyond just a generalized identity.</p>
  <p> This value that I place on independence is something that I know others around me admire because it is something that I get asked for advice about. I have friends and family members who, as much as they wish they could be, can not seem to break the confines of co-dependence. I wish I had answers for them, but this adventurous spirit that drives me is just something that is so innate it can't be ignored. When I feel trapped in places or situations I do not think to escape, I just do. I feel compelled into action by something that is so much bigger than me that I can not contain it. The only question I really ever ask is... SO WHO'S COMING WITH ME?!?</p>

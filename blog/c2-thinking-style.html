"My Gregorc Thinking Style: Concrete Random"

I took a test about how I think and learn. It's probably one of the more informative tests I've ever taken. Most tests tell me what I've learned, or didn't learn, never how I learn. And I have to say, reading through the descriptions, the test definitely wasn't wrong- it all sounds like me, except one point, which I will discuss. So what did I score? How do I think and learn? I scored the title Concrete Random Thinker.

Here is what is said about the Concrete Pereceptual Quality aspect of my thinking style:

This quality enables you to register information directly through your five senses: sight, smell, touch, taste, and hearing. When you are using your concrete ability, you are dealing with the obvious, the "here and now." You are not looking for hidden meanings, or making relationships between ideas or concepts.

This is where I find one indiscretion- I love to find relationships between ideas and concepts! I am a right-brain dominant thinker (this was another test I took), meaning I look at the big picture, not neccessarily little details in a linear fashion. Everything is connected, everything builds upon one another, and it helps me tremendously to find points of connection between information in order to see the big picture and understand the individual parts better. However, I do agree that I am a learner through my senses. I must experience something to really know it and understand it.

For the Abstract Ordering Ability aspect of my thinking style, this is what is said about it (and I must say, its me to a T!):

 Lets your mind organize information by chunks, and in no particular order. When you are using your random ability, you may often be able to skip steps in a procedure and still produce the desired result. You may even start in the middle, or at the end, and work backwards. You may also prefer your life to be more impulsive, or spur of the moment, than planned.

This is why I was so terrible at math proofs! I was always skipping steps, and didn't even know I was, my brain was just jumping ahead. I'm also terrible at teaching other people skills, like math, and even snowboarding- I don't know how I know, I just know. And I am very impulsive- I like to move around a lot, never with a plan, just a nagging sense of I must go somewhere new. For some people the lack of structure that I live by would be frightening, but for me it keeps life exciting, and hey, its that exact impulsion that got me to DBC-one minute I was web-surfing, the next I was applying, and a couple weeks later I was in and dropping serious cash on a compeletely new endeavour that I had never dreamed of pursuing.

As a Concrete Random Thinker, these are the more specific learning styles that work best for me:

This learner likes:
-experimenting to find answers
-taking risks
-using their intuition
-solving problems independently

They learn best when:
-they are able to use trial-and-error approaches
-able to compete with others
-given the opportunity to work through the problems by themselves.

What's hard for them?
-Restrictions and limitations
-Formal reports
-Routines
-Re-doing anything once it's done
-Keeping detailed records
-Showing how they got an answer
-Choosing only one answer
-Having no options

Yes, yes, yes, to all of that! Routines, ugh, no options, my soul is being crushed! Using intuition, taking risks- this is what I live by! So how can I use all of this to my advantage at DBC? Well, like I said, its all of this that even got me to DBC in the first place, so that's pretty awesome. If I look at everything on this list though, I'd have to say that the greatest asset to me so far at DBC has been my experiemental mind. When I look for solutions to code, I try everything I can think of, until finally something is right. I actually don't restrict myself to time-constraints (although I know time-boxing will be good for some projects), because when I'm in the flow, I don't want that to be halted by a routine break. My thinking style is also a pretty independent style, so being able to just code for hours by myself has been great. I really enjoy just being alone, with my computer, sunshine or moonshine streaming through the open windows. I thought Pair Programming was going to be difficult because of this independent attitude, but I find it to be a good challenge. I will have to get better at working in a team for when I get a job, so I better learn to overcome some of these innate thinking habits now, such as not being good at showing how I got to an answer. Now that I know how I think, I need to focus on tracking my thoughts, so I can better understand where my mind is going and then getting it to go where I want it to.

Overall, I have a deep thirst for knowledge and a sincere enjoyment of learning. I definitely consider myself to have a growth mindset. Learning is all about effort. If I don't try to learn new things, I will never know them. For instance, I had really never painted in my life, until a few years ago. I did actually have a fixed mindset when it came to the arts. I did think that some people were just born with innate abilities towards painting and music. One day though, I decided that the reason I couldn't paint was because I had never tried. Some people may have an innate calling towards something, but anyone can learn how to do anything. Once I started painting, I then turned to the violin. Lo and behold, not only can I paint, but I can play music too! And now... I can code! The possible skills I can develop are endless, and it all starts with trying new things. One thing I do need to work on though, is being more open to learning from others. Like I said before, my thinking style is rather independent, but if I broaden my horizons and seek more interactions with others, the skills I can be exposed to and pick up myself greatly increases.

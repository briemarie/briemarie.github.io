<h2> "CSS: Short for Color, Style, and Spacing... Just Kidding!" <br />
  <span> September 25, 2014 </span></h2>

<div>
  <p>
    When first starting off using CSS, you may wonder about the difference between the margin, border, and padding properties of your HTML content. They basically seem like window frames within window frames. I like to think of them in more humorous terms- padding is the underwear, it goes closest to the content, then comes the boarder, which is the pants and jacket, and finally, the margin is the personal space bubble. Whether you want to utilize all these layers is up to your personal preference, and the occasion. If you choose not to specify their sizes and colors, these layers will be set to a default, and still exist, but you just may not notice them. For example, unless you change the colors, you may not notice they are there at all, but they are really just blending in with the background.
  </p>

    <p>
      Here is a simplified picture of the layers, and in a moment I will explain more in depth about their various functions.
    </p>

<img src="http://xhtml.com/8FCEE4B2-AF88-4574-BBC6-3C94FBD64380/border-box-model.gif"class="centeredImage" alt="CSS Framing" height="300px" width="400px">

<p>
  As you can see, the padding is the space between the content and the border. Since everyting in CSS is essentially a box, whether the content is a single letter, a sentence, a paragraph, an image, a div, or a table, everything essentially has a border, even if you can't see it. By specifying the padding size, which you can set to all four sides differently or equally, you push or bring in the border closer or further away from your content- boxers or briefs if you will.
</p>

<p>
  Now the margin on the other hand is the space outside the border, and it doesn't really affect the content as much as it affects your contents' relationship to other content on the page. If your margin is set to a higher number, other content will stay far away, but if it is set to 0 (this is usually the default), other content will be rubbing right up in the other contents' personal space.
</p>

<p>
  There are several ways you can go about setting up the various sizes of the padding, border, and margins around the content of your page.You can use the following: </p>
  <p>
  px: for pixels, basically one single dot on your screen.<br />
  pt: for point, like a pixel, it is only 1/72 of an inch.<br />
  %: which will make the padding, border, or margin a percentage of the content size<br />
  or, simply<br />
  cm: for centimeter, or<br />
  in: for inches.
</p>

<p>
  You can also choose how specific you want to be in your code.<br />

  Look at the following examples:</p>
<p>
  square {<br />
        margin: 10px<br />
  }<br />

  rectangle {<br />
        margin: 10px, 5px, 10px, 5px<br />
  }</p>

  <p>
  The 10px you see for square is denoting that all sides will be the same size. <br />
  The numbering for the rectangle is showing that you want the top margin to be 10px, the right margin to be 5px, the bottom margin to be 10px, and the left margin to be 5px. Like a clock it starts on top, and works its way around.
</p>

<p>
And that my friends is the basics of padding, borders, and margins in CSS. The rest is up to you to play around with and get the feel for what numbers look like what around the content of your page.</p>

<p>And remember... its CSS... its ok to be a...</p>

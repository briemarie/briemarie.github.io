<h2> "Array vs. Hash" <br />
  <span> October 4, 2014 </span></h2>

<div>
<p>
When I first encountered these two classes in Ruby, the first one, array, made sense. It is an array (an ordered arrangement)of objects, that can vary from integers and floats to strings, all of which can be saved within the same array. The second class, hash, even though it is similar to an array in concept had me asking, "Why is it called a hash?" The title just didn't seem to reveal what it was, until I looked up hash in the dictionary. Hash is not just a food, or slang for something you smoke, the definition of hash is: a mixture of jumbled incongruous things; a mess. While nothing in well-written Ruby code is actually a mess, this helped me see one of the big differences between arrays and hashes. An array, following its definition, is an ordered arrangement, for ex.
</p>

<code>favorite_things = ["elephants", "chocolate", 5, "green", 1987] </code>

<p>Even though an array can contain different kinds of objects, they all fall under the name of the array, and are related and ordered by this.</p>

<p>A hash on the other hand contains much more information, because instead of being basically just a list within brackets, like an array, hashes contain keys and values, giving it more layers of information.  Lets see what the above example would look like in hash form:</p>

<code>favorite_things { <br />
  animal: "elephant", <br />
  food: "chocolate", <br />
  number: 5, <br />
  color: "green",<br />
  year: 1987<br />
}</code>

<p>As you can see, its not really a mess, it makes perfect sense how these things go together, but if we were to look at just  the keys(in this case animal, food, number, color, green) they do seem like incongruous things. They only become related by  their values being related as favorite things.</p>

<p>In my personal opinion hashes are the superior way to store information, simply because it is much easier to access the stored info. If I were to want to access my favorite color in the array, the only way to find it would be to point to its position in the array, using an integer. The first item in the array is given the value 0, the second is 1, and so forth. So, I would need to know that color was the fourth item and access it by typing:</p>

<code>favorite_things[3]</code>

<p>With hashes though, you can access the information by using the key, which to me is much easier to remember. So, I could find my favorite color by typing:</p>

<code>favorite_things[color]</code>

<p>As far as methods go, almost all the same methods can be used for both arrays and hashes, some of the most common being .each, .include?, and .length, making hashes and arrays equally useful. However, like I said before, hashes seem logically superior based on the fact that you can access the value by the key, instead of a place-holder integer.

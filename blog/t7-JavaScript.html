<h2> "A Method to the Madness"   <br />
  <span> October 29, 2014 </span></h2>

<div>
  <p> This week at DBC, we switched gears and started learning the basics of JavaScript. We started off by reading <a href ="http://eloquentjavascript.net/Eloquent">Eloquent JavaScript</a>, and while I was, at first, intrigued by the title, I was soon not feeling the so called elegance of this Language. It seemed a bit too complex and yet also a bit too flexible, but this is probably because as a beginner I like easy-to-understand, concrete building blocks. I know though, that once I reach higher levels of dev experience, flexibility will be a great asset in programming, so I am trying not to judge JS too soon. I am already finding that simply moving from reading about JS theory to actual practice in completing this week's challenges, that JS is not as difficult as it seems when written out in paragraph form. So far it has actually been easier to pull out errors, easier to refactor, and easier to implement code based on test driven development techniques. Ruby and JS, both being object-oriented languages do share many basic elements, and so the leap from learning Ruby to learning JS is not too far. However, how these two languages treat similar elements is where most of the difference comes in. I would like to explore one of these differences that involves both languages' use of methods, and consequently, objects.</p>
  <p>In Ruby, there are basically two major umbrellas that all concepts fall under- objects and methods. Objects are like the nouns of English, and methods are like the verbs. A method in Ruby is any kind of action that is performed by an object or on an object. A method can be called directly on an object by using the dot <code>.</code> syntax, or by making a chunk of code that starts with <code>def</code> (for define method) and ends with <code>end</code>. Below is an  example of both versions being used one within an another:</p>

  <code>def empty?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;array.length == 0<br />
  end</code>

<p>In JavaScript, methods are also actions that can be called on objects. And in JS, objects are also some of the same things that they are in Ruby- strings, arrays, numbers. And, like in Ruby, many of the same methods for these objects are present, such as .push and .pop to add or remove elements in an array, or .length to find the length of a string. And yes, the dot notation is how you call a method on an object in JS. So, is there any difference besides the extra syntactical way in Ruby to define a method? The short answer is no, they are the same. The long answer is yes, they are different. Simply put, both languages have methods that are actions called on objects. But, the difference lies in what an object is in Ruby and what it is in JS. In Ruby, an object is anything that isn't a method, and actually just to complicate things, even methods are objects. Think of it in terms of the English language- a method is a set of actions, so its basically a set of verbs, but the fact that it is a set, makes it a noun. An object in JS is a piece of code that has values and properties. If it doesn't have these things, its just a variable. Now a variable can point to an object, such as a string, but they are different. The long definition of a method in JS is actually the properties of an object that contain functions. What are considered properties and functions in JS are simply methods in Ruby. Here is an example:</p>

<code>var array = []<br />
array.push("Hello");</code>

<p> What is going on in the JS method is that there is a variable (array), whose value is an array([]), and since an array has the properties associated with it such as being able to have elements added or deleted or joined, array is an object and the method is those properties in the form of an action, such as actually pushing a new element into an array, which is a function of the property of the array object. Try saying that five times fast.</p>
<p>So, I hope you see the method to the madness of methods, and not just the madness after reading this. Maybe now you can understand though why I prefer Ruby. JavaScript, while built upon the same principles as Ruby, is a more convoluted language if you ask me. But then again, ask anyone trying to learn English when it is not their native tongue, and they will tell you the same thing.</p>

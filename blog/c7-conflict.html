<h2> The Compass of Shame.. No it's not a Pirates of the Carribean sequel..  <br />
  <span> November 3, 2014 </span></h2>

<div>
  <p> The Compass of Shame... dun.. dun.. dun!! This theory sounds so ominous, and its implications actually are if shame is not brought under control. However, its not as hopeless as it sounds. One is not doomed to travel this way and that, one day north, another day west, forever trying to escape shame or other unpleasant emotions. Really the Compass of Shame is a great tool for identifying coping strategies that people use for dealing with harsh emotions. As with most things, once the coping strategy is identified, the individual can go beyond the unhealthy habit and learn to deal with negative emotions more effectively.</p>
  <p> I personally am not exempt from this compass, and throughout my life have been traveling between the north and south ends of the poles. I have battled many addictions in my life trying to escape the pain and shame and depression I have felt since I was a kid. I can happily say now that I don't have any unhealthy addictions that take over my life, and I am very grateful that I have found ways of kicking the habits that once plagued me. But, I still engage in escapism when it comes to dealing with tough situations. A little while ago, one of my best friends and I got into a large disagreement. I love this girl and have known her for half my life, but we are very different. We have different personalities, lead very different lives, and hold a few different beliefs about life and the world. When we got into this argument we both also coped with the high emotions very differently. I for one, shut down, shut her out, and ignored the building tensions. Obviously this did not help the situation, running away from problems never does. Fortunately, I was talking to another friend, about an entirely different subject, and the advice she inadvertently gave helped me see where I had been wrong, and instead of continuing to run further, I faced the fact and apologized. I am lucky enough to have been forgiven, and she apologized as well, seeing where she had been wrong also. We did not mean to hurt each other, we had both just been reacting to the situation in our own personally screwed up ways. Both of our habitual compasses suddenly pointed us in our deranged coping directions, and we split apart for a time.</p>
  <p> I can't say I would have done anything differently though, now being on the other side of the disagreement, because we both learned something about ourselves and each other that we wouldn't have been faced with otherwise. Sometimes it takes these moments to really bring people together on deeper levels. And it brings us face to face with the darkest parts of our own being, which we need to do to reality check us sometimes- to know that we aren't perfect and have flaws that have been unconciously learned throughout our lives, usually as survival mechanisms that we can't be ashamed of, but also can never stop trying to go beyond.</p>
